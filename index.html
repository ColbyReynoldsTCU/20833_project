    <h2>How Audiences React to Superman Across Three Generations</h2>
    <p>
      This project combines computational methods and humanities-based interpretation to analyze audience reviews
      for <em>Superman Returns</em> (2006), <em>Man of Steel</em> (2013), and <em>Superman</em> (2025).
      We use sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word frequency tools to explore how reactions to Superman
      have changed over time.
    </p>
   
  </section>

  <main>
    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="overview">
      <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Superman has been continuously reinvented on screen, and each version says something different about
        what audiences expect from a hero. In this project, we analyze audience reviews for three major Superman
        films: <em>Superman Returns</em> (2006), <em>Man of Steel</em> (2013), and <em>Superman</em> (2025).
        Building on the technical and rhetorical skills we developed in HW4-1 and HW4-2, we moved from
        analyzing a single dataset to comparing how reactions shift across different eras and creative
        directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each film, we scraped audience reviews (from IMDb for 2006 and 2013, and Rotten Tomatoes for 2025),
        cleaned the text, and ran sentiment analysis, term frequency analysis, topic modeling, and word cloud
        visualizations. This main page explains our research question, methods, and overall findings, while the
        individual movie pages dive into the detailed charts and interpretations for each film.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- RESEARCH QUESTION -->
    <section class="research-question">
      <h2 class="section-title">Research Question</h2>
      <p>
        Our central question was:
        <strong>How have audience reactions to Superman films changed over time, and what
        themes and emotions dominate those responses?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, each of us planned to focus on just one movie and one dataset. However, as we looked at the
        early results from our homework assignments, we realized that the more interesting story was
        comparative. Superman is not just a single character; he is a cultural symbol that gets redesigned for
        each new generation. That led us to expand the project from one film to three.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hypothesized that <em>Superman Returns</em> (2006) would show more nostalgic and steady positivity;
        that <em>Man of Steel</em> (2013) would produce highly polarized reactions; and that
        <em>Superman</em> (2025) would divide viewers between excitement for James Gunn’s new direction and
        skepticism about changing such an iconic character. This research question guided our tool choices and
        how we interpreted the language patterns we found.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- METHODS -->
    <section class="methods">
      <h2 class="section-title">Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Our methods combined data collection, text cleaning, and several layers of computational analysis.
        First, we scraped audience reviews for each film: IMDb reviews for <em>Superman Returns</em> and
        <em>Man of Steel</em>, and the 200 most recent audience reviews from Rotten Tomatoes for
        <em>Superman</em> (2025). These platforms provide large, user-generated texts that reflect everyday
        audience reactions rather than professional critic reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        After collecting the data, we cleaned the text by lowercasing, removing punctuation, and filtering out
        English stopwords. This produced a simplified version of each review that was easier for our models to
        process, while still preserving key words like character names, emotional descriptors, and film-related
        terms. We then applied two different sentiment tools: VADER, which is sensitive to emotional intensity
        and slang, and TextBlob, which gives a smoother polarity score. Using both allowed us to compare
        “emotional spikes” with more general tonal trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        To explore what audiences actually talk about, we used term frequency analysis to identify the most
        common words for each film. We then used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to group
        related words into themes, such as action, character development, nostalgia, or the wider DC universe.
        Finally, we generated word clouds to visualize which names, adjectives, and concepts appear most
        prominently in the reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        These methods have limitations. Online reviews are self-selected and over-represent people who feel
        strongly enough to post. Sentiment tools sometimes misread sarcasm or mixed feelings, and topic
        modeling can group words in ways that require careful interpretation. However, by combining multiple
        methods and cross-checking our computational outputs with close reading of sample reviews, we built a
        richer and more reliable picture of audience reception across the three films.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FINDINGS -->
    <section class="findings">
      <h2 class="section-title">Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Across the three films, our analysis confirmed that audience reactions to Superman are not static—they
        change with tone, direction, and cultural context. <em>Superman Returns</em> (2006) showed a strong,
        consistent lean toward positive sentiment. VADER revealed a large spike near +1.0, and common words
        focused on “superman,” “movie,” “Lois,” “Lex,” and “character,” suggesting that many viewers appreciated
        its nostalgic and emotional approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Man of Steel</em> (2013), by contrast, displayed more polarization. VADER showed strong spikes on
        both the positive and negative sides, while TextBlob indicated a mix of neutral and slightly positive
        reviews. Frequent terms like “action,” “story,” “Superman,” “Krypton,” and “feel” suggest that viewers
        were deeply engaged with the film’s darker tone, intense action, and moral complexity—sometimes in
        admiration, and sometimes in frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <em>Superman</em> (2025), early Rotten Tomatoes reviews leaned positive overall, with VADER
        capturing enthusiastic language about the “movie,” “story,” “character,” and James Gunn’s direction.
        TextBlob showed that many reviews were slightly positive or neutral, indicating that while a core group
        of fans responded very strongly, another group offered more measured praise or mild criticism. These
        patterns largely matched our hypotheses, but also revealed more steady positivity for 2006 and 2025
        than we initially expected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- INTEGRATION & REFLECTION -->
    <section class="integration-reflection">
      <h2 class="section-title">Integration &amp; Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This project required us to integrate humanities-style interpretation with computational tools. Close
        reading alone can show how one or two reviews talk about Superman, but it struggles to reveal patterns
        across thousands of comments. By using sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word frequencies, we
        were able to see large-scale trends in how audiences describe tone, character, and story across
        different Superman eras.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the computational outputs only became meaningful when we interpreted them using
        humanities perspectives. A spike in positive sentiment matters less by itself than when we connect it
        to questions like: What kind of Superman do people want? Why do some viewers react strongly against
        darker portrayals? How does nostalgia influence reception of newer films? In this sense, computation
        did not replace close reading; it extended it. It allowed us to zoom out, see the bigger picture of
        audience reaction, and then zoom back in to understand what those reactions say about how Superman
        functions as a cultural symbol today.
