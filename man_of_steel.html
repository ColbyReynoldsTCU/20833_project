  <h2>Analysis Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Initially, I thought most viewers would just enjoy Man of Steel, but the data tells a more complex story. TextBlob showed that many reviews were neutral or slightly positive, yet VADER revealed sharper spikes in both positive and negative reactions. The largest spike at 0.00 confirms that a big group of viewers felt neutral, while the spike at 1.00 shows that fans who loved the movie were very enthusiastic. Smaller negative spikes, although less numerous, were intense, showing the movie divides audiences more than I expected.

  <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    VADER helped me see the emotional intensity behind the reviews. Fans who loved the movie expressed very strong positive sentiment while critics used equally strong negative language. This suggests that people aren’t just reacting to the plot — they care about how Superman is portrayed, his moral decisions, and whether the story meets their expectations for a hero.

  <p>
    TextBlob smoothed out reactions, showing mostly neutral reviews with a small peak at slight positivity. This triangle-like distribution suggests that a large portion of commentary is descriptive or observational. Comparing TextBlob and VADER highlights how different tools can reveal different aspects of audience response: TextBlob shows general tone, while VADER captures emotional extremes.

<section class="term-frequency">
  <h2>Term Frequency</h2>
  <p>
    The most frequent words reveal what audiences focused on: pacing, action, and Superman himself. Words like “action,” “story,” and “superman” dominate, while smaller but significant words like “feel,” “love,” and “Krypton” show that people care about emotional depth and worldbuilding. This indicates that viewers are noticing both spectacle and the emotional impact of the film.

<section class="topic-modeling">
  <h2>Topic Modeling</h2>
  <p>
    LDA topic modeling identified three clusters: action and general impressions, story and character development, and the Superman universe including core characters. This separation shows that audiences process different elements independently — some focus on excitement and spectacle, others on moral and emotional complexity, and others on the iconic Superman mythology. It suggests that viewers engage with multiple layers of the movie at once.

<section class="wordcloud">
  <h2>Word Cloud</h2>
  <p>
    The word cloud reinforces the focus on tone, action, and Superman’s character. Names like Clark, Snyder, and Cavill indicate that audiences pay attention to both the characters and the creators shaping the story. Smaller words reveal emotional engagement and worldbuilding, emphasizing that viewers are invested in how Superman is reimagined, not just in the spectacle.

<section class="conclusion">
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <p>
    My initial assumption that most people would simply enjoy the movie was too simplistic. The data shows clear polarization: some viewers are enthusiastic fans while others are strongly critical. Audiences react to more than plot or action — they respond to character portrayal, moral complexity, and the emotional tone of the story. The analysis also reveals that Superman’s modern interpretation challenges cultural expectations about heroism, morality, and emotional depth. Overall, Man of Steel evokes strong, varied reactions, highlighting how superhero stories are now a space where spectacle and deeper ethical and emotional questions intersect.
