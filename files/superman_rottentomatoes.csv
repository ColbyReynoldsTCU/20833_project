"DJ","Oct 3, 2025","I like the movie and I think it's a good first movie for the restart, I hope they can capitalize"
"Matt D","Oct 3, 2025","Special effects lacked, the plot was lacking, the flight scenes were pretty poor, the acting was terrible (Lex) 

The only.goodnpart was the original sound track in the first 2 minutes... everything after that wasn't worth watching"
"PIXELEYE P","Oct 3, 2025","This movie is HOPE!
Superman (2025) finally portrays the character exactly as he should be: loving, caring, incorruptible, and driven by an unshakable will to save lives and prevent death, no matter who is in danger. He inspires people to do good simply by being himself. This Superman loves life, and the film makes kindness and optimism its central themes, which is what superman is all about. 

The tone is (finally) readjusted from the darker, conflicted and ""edgy"" versions we’ve seen in recent years, to a bright, colorful, and uplifting theme, which truly fits the character better. It feels like a true return to the heart of Superman, while still feeling fresh and modern. 

Loved how the film introduced new and lesser-known characters, such as Mr. Terrific, in a re-imagined and genuinely cool way. They managed to make these secondary heroes likable and engaging, while the story never loses focus on the main character. It remains a Superman movie (not a Justice League movie) while still expanding the world!

The music deserves its own praise. The score reimagines the classic Superman theme in a modern style, and it fits perfectly. Blending nostalgia with a powerful and updated sound! 


Usually not a fan of superhero movies but this movie was a genuinely good watch!"
"Maddison K.","Oct 3, 2025","Good enough for a fun family movie night! Made me a fan of Corenswet - thought he was a wonderful casting choice."
"Richard L","Oct 3, 2025","I am SOOOOO glad I passed on this in theaters. Just watched, for free, on cable.

It is one of the worst movies ever. Not one thing about it was likable or believable. Suspension of disbelief was never felt.

Remember when they remade HULK over, and over, and over? Yup, here we go again.

They seriously gotta come up with the 0.25 Star setting. And yes, its that bad"
"Lala L","Oct 3, 2025","The world has gone stupid"
"Laurence&Diane C","Oct 2, 2025","I absolutely loved this film, great actors and on screen chemistry, family friendly and a breath of fresh air."
"James J.","Oct 2, 2025","This is the first movie I have seen James Gunn make with a beloved superhero already. So this is a step up from Guardians of the Galaxy because they were not very loved before him. This movie single handedly made me fall in love with Superman again. Gunn is so good at making me feel apart of his world and his ideas. David Corenswet is perfect as Superman, even though I think he didn’t get to be Clark Kent enough and I am still waiting to see if he will be great as Clark, from what I saw I loved. The music in this movie is top notch and it made me feel immersed in this universe. Waiting for the Supergirl movie."
"Grayson L.","Oct 2, 2025","Wow. These flying scenes are CRAZY AWESOME!!! Now this wasn’t GOOD OR BAD. I’m just gonna say you’re either gonna like it or hate it NO INBETWEEN. But that’s different for me, IT WAS MID. But hey, WHY DID THEY HAVE LIKE 10 VILLIANS AT THE SAME TIME. Solid 3 and a half💀👍"
"Hayl E","Oct 2, 2025","Heartwarming, fun, incredibly relevant in today's climate."
"Diallo G","Oct 2, 2025","As soon as I saw Krypto the Super Pooch, I was out.  But then the reviews made me curious, and the trailer showed some humor, so I decided to give it a try.

Better than I thought!  They somehow managed to make both a really old school Superman, with boy scout values, and permanently modeled super-hair, and at the same time put him in a modernized world that could barely understand him, and which he could barely understand.  Lex Luthor was definitely the most formidable Luthor yet.  

And the movie makers found a way around the fatal flaw of Superman as a character--that he's the Swiss-army knife of superheroes, and is invincible unless someone can find yet another piece of that little green rock.  By taking a bit of the piss out of Superman and the other heroes (thank you Incredibles and The Boys), while investing in his simple goodness in a morally compromised world, they were able to make fun of this classic superhero and make love to him at the same time.  

And he took it like a champ!"
"Tarrie S","Oct 2, 2025","Just watched Superman and I wish I could give it negative Zero stars. This has to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. This was so sad because I love the superman story. My advise if your want to watch a fantastic superman story see Christopher Reeves version, that's how the story of Superman is supposed to be. This Movie was way to violent, breeding cruelty to animals. Came across as cold, violent and with no feeling. Earth parents are supposed to be the teachers of good, Not be dumb. You think with a dog its going to be at least light hearted, no dont be fooled. I will never gets those 2 hours back. Save your money and time."
"Steve  H","Oct 2, 2025","I read a lot of stuff about this film being not too good, but was amazed how fun it was! Take me back to the Zack films and I was saying I would not watch this... but... it was quite good, fun and just reminds me of the old days where Superman could be hurt and actually was human, well done."
"Danielle P","Oct 2, 2025","Very slow. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. It got so much hype and it was bad...."
"Owen S","Oct 2, 2025","Just awful, it's if they made a B series into a movie. Every Superman movie prior to this was better."
"Jay B","Oct 2, 2025","I believe that this is the start of something new... It shows hope even in the darkest times, It shows a man who no matter what still has hope and makes it his goal despite being hated to give the world joy.... Maybe this is the real punk rock....."
"Dustin A","Oct 1, 2025","Really disliked this movie. So many plot holes. Dumb fight scene concept, just bad"
"little k","Oct 1, 2025","James Gunn's Superman is a fantastic must-see movie. The film has excellent visuals, but also a great story. Corenswet plays the best Superman since the days of Christopher Reeve."
"Elijah M","Oct 1, 2025","Amazing start for the first DCU movie in the chapter and a good man movie in a while."
"Zoltan G","Oct 1, 2025","PROS. 
Honestly this is my favorite live action Superman film.
I watched it like three times I really enjoy it still im finally more optimistic for the DCU.

people say there are too many charchters in this film I understand in some regard but I think its nonsense, in this case the side heores aside from Mr Terrific they are barely in the film they are probably in it for like 10 minutes or less altogether.

Superman overall is finally comic accurate I have some gripes with him tho.
I didn't agree with James Gunns viewpoint on making Superman vulnerable, I personally don't mind it when he does it with Lois, but near the end with Lex Luthor him telling Lex his feelings are hurt just makes him look weak in the eyes of his arch nemesis, its like giving away your weakness to your worst enemy.

Lois Lane has a good amount of screen time and is actually helpful with superman.

Lex Luthor, probably the best live action Lex Luthor we've had since Smallville not terrifying as a villain in this movie but he definitely does think ahead in this film.

Krypto was a little unescarry imo.

CONS.
The suit can look more defined i think and add a little more muscle padding.
Some cases of modern politics but I don't think it really takes away from the story.
But please if anyone from WB or DC reads this try to avoid being political in the future the audience can tell if your trying to push a political agenda and people simply go to the movies to be entertained.
Overall great film."
"Marv R","Oct 1, 2025","""SPOILERS""
Very lack luster. Superman whines a lot. Gun makes John and Martha Kent looks like dimwits, Superman go so far out of his way not to get anyone killed, but then tosses his clone into a black hole and then EVERY other JL member goes of killing those that stand against them especially Hawk Girl. The movie was just complete hypocrisy. Green Lantern and Lois where the only ones I could get behind with the acting. Gunn does great bringing unknown characters to life, but these well established Heroes and it shows how he doesn't know how to handle that. I found it funny how Corenswets eyebrows kept reverting to his natural brown/blondish color. Really helped point out the die job."
"Shakeel K","Oct 1, 2025","5/5 because this film made me punk rocker🍿"
"Suhail A","Oct 1, 2025","Was a pretty mid comic book movie for DC's standards but an alright watch. James Gunn has some work to do if he wants his universe to stand peer to peer with Marvel's Infinity saga which was much better crafted. The best DC universe ever created imo is still the animated DCAMU from Flashpoint till the Apokolips War movie."
"Anthony R.","Oct 1, 2025","Loved the comic book style my favorite character was Mr. terrific"
"Edward W","Oct 1, 2025","(Spoilers)
I am so sad. I was really looking forward to the James Gunn reboot but my hopes have been dashed. How this movie gets a rating of over 80% is proof that there are class A drugs in the water system. 

Corenswet does a good job of Superman. Brosnahan is a plausible Lois Lane. With a different script, they could have been iconic. I'd say the movie has plot holes but the entire movie is a plot hole with a bit of dialog.

Superman is simultaneously the most powerful metahuman ever seen but gets beaten up by B graders every 15 minutes. He needs rescuing more often than Lois Lane in the George Reeves series.

He's supposed to have super-speed but Lex Luthor can dictate fighting moves to beat him up in real time. Speaking of Lex, he is simultaneously the smartest and dumbest person on the planet. His motives and strategies are utterly incomprehensible. Lex should be clever and manipulative not clinically delusional.

To top it all, Jor El and Lara sent him to Earth to be a despot and mass 'struggle-cuddler'.

This movie should carry a government health warning. You will come out dumber than when you went in."
"Delphine S","Oct 1, 2025","I absolutely loved this movie—it’s fun, full of hope, and brings back the kind of Superman I’ve always wanted to see. This version of Clark is approachable, good-hearted, and even a little geeky in the best way, which makes him so relatable. It’s a true feel-good film, with an amazing cast and music."
"Friendly R","Oct 1, 2025","A weird take on Superman.  He yells and screams at Lois during an argument and comes across as immature and inept.  Lois is unappealing in every way.  Lots of meta-humans clog up the story and are boring in their own right.  Thank goodness for the dog."
"reaper h","Oct 1, 2025","The worst movie ever made James Gunn should stick his head in a hole. the only good acting in the whole movie was from a dog."
"Lord C","Oct 1, 2025","The only good things about the movie are Louis Lane and Lex Luthor, the rest is a mess. There are several errors where his film is definitely not and cannot be considered part of the main DC universe.. Unnecessary screen long time like the opening part of Mr. Incredible's garage,"
"Mike and Cindy D","Oct 1, 2025","Pick your poison.  The movie seems like it’s set up for old-time Superman with kid friendly characters and dialogue although includes significant gratuitous violence that doesn’t add to the story.  The Green Lantern using his power to give the finger to the enemy.  Missed the mark on this one."
"brandon b","Oct 1, 2025","Not only the worst Superman has ever seen but maybe the worst movie I've ever seen."
"Evelyn A","Oct 1, 2025","Just. No. Unless you like wasting time. It's sad what they've done to the Superman franchise. Who, at the end of this film, said, ""job well done!"" They should not be allowed to make films."
"Brayden H.","Sep 30, 2025","This movie absolutely out did superheroes in such a great lighting compared to the recent years. The entire movie is so much fun. CGI is amazing and It doesn’t clash with any of the costumes. It was probably the best superhero movie I’ve seen in a long time. David cornswet was a perfect cast for Superman the way he portrayed his emotions It really made me care for Superman."
"Jason F","Sep 30, 2025","Not sure what these top reviews watched. This was a complete flop. Green lantern was a dumpy guy??  Awful trash."
"Joe W","Sep 30, 2025","I'll qualify myself. I am a classic superman fan. The ones with Christopher Reeve are my favorite. Simple. Banter between Lois and Clark not knowing who he is mostly, but the tease. A bad guy, usually Lex Luthor or someone like him. Good vs. Bad. I liked to 2006 one also with Brandon Routh. Same premise. 
This new one ruined the dynamic of Lois and Clark as he was already exposed to her as superman. I hated that. And then it became insanely cluttered with other superheros and otherworldly villians and alternate universes and stuff that just didn't belong in a superman movie. 
If I wasn't there with someone else I would have left before it ended. Afterwards she said the same thing to me. If the trailer for the next one looks anything like this one, I'm out."
"Mitch B","Sep 30, 2025","I loved this movie. It was fun and action packed and who hasn't wanted to see Superman fight a Godzilla like monster on the big screen.  I loved the retro feel to it and the fact that it had the feel of an episode of a television show. Lois Lane and Lex Luthor were also highlights for me.  While not perfect, and I felt it could have done better with the Kents and there was sometimes way too much shouting, I felt this movie  was a blast.  An A-."
"Gabriel S","Sep 30, 2025","This movie was so poorly written I cannot explain to you how unbearable it was to watch."
"James R","Sep 30, 2025","Honestly I don't know how so many people enjoyed this movie. While watching it I was extremely frustrated with how pathetic and weak they made Superman. The concept or the plot line could have been great if it took a different path. But definitely a very big letdown."
"Wa C","Sep 30, 2025","Really did not enjoy this film. Including Krypto was annoying. Completely mischaracterized Kal-el parents. No onscreen chemistry between the David and Rachel. Nonsensical subplot with Jimmy Olson.

Usually James Gunn films are at least passable, but this is almost the worst Superman film I’ve ever watched."
"Hayden S","Sep 30, 2025","Superman has an interesting premise and a stellar performance from Edi Gathegi, but Superman himself is a blah in this disjointed Reboot."
"Chaise H","Sep 30, 2025","Worst movie I've ever watched. ""Man of Steel"" remains my favorite, by a mile."
"Jarrett B","Sep 30, 2025","How??? Just how did anyone enjoy this atrocious adaptation of the greatest DC hero. Ultimate fail."
"Mike M","Sep 30, 2025","This movies was horrible geared more towards the younger fan maybe no real story line way too much CGI and they took way too many Liberties with the Superman character and his background."
"M A","Sep 30, 2025","Horrible movie! I don’t ever give reviews, but this was a truly a huge disappointment. Cast and storyline terrible. Horrible Superman and Green Lantern especially. I don’t understand how this movie is a success and I like James Gunn movies, but definitely not this one. I understood how some people didn’t like everything about Snyders look and take, but this was a huge step backwards. Henry Cavill is by far the better Superman."
"Byron K","Sep 29, 2025","Honestly, James Gun knows how to bring fun back to movies.  You would think with bigger budgets he would be more cautious, thank the movies gods that he is allowed some freedom to make film that still have the DIY film making roots to them.  Great story, great casting, so much fun to watch."
"Emil G","Sep 29, 2025","This movie is just dumb. Waste od time compared to man of steel. Cheap jokes, cheap villains, poor script writing."
"JB","Sep 29, 2025","The worst Superman and action hero movie. I was disappointed in the portrayal of all the characters. It was dumb."
"Will","Sep 29, 2025","Not bad. Not great but it is a GOOD start up for this version of Supes."
"Alexander G","Sep 29, 2025","Horrible writing. No real story, characters with zero depth or meaningful backstories, no emotions. The physics are laughably bad, and the humans act like NPCs — just hanging out (instead of running away) while Superman fights a giant monster. And then the whole world turns against the man who’s protected them his entire life after watching one video? Really? That’s just lazy writing. What you get is a collection of random scenes, convenient storytelling, and flashy CGI with jokes tossed in for no reason. At times, it feels more like an SNL skit or a parody. And sure, make Superman more “human,” but don’t turn him into a Super Baby with the emotional maturity of a five-year-old."
"Mark D","Sep 29, 2025","I almost turned it off after the first 10 minutes, forced myself to watch the rest and I wish I hadn't.  Bad acting, bad cgi, terrible casting."
"Vojin P","Sep 29, 2025","Offensive and lazy. Using a fake name for a country and then using a real language Serbo Croatian for the president of it is just unacceptable. Things like this should get movies like this banned and canceled."
"Gregory E.","Sep 29, 2025","“Superman (2025)” — ★★★★☆

If you’re looking for a superhero film that balances spectacle with heart, this new Superman delivers. Lex Luthor (played by Nicholas Hoult) is suitably menacing and clever — not just a mustache-twirling villain, but a real threat to Clark’s world. Superman (David Corenswet) feels both powerful and vulnerable, making his journey engaging without becoming predictable.

The action sequences are solid — the ice crystal / robot battles had real visual flair — and Krypto steals scenes (in both goofy and savage ways). The humor lands more often than not, and the moments between characters (especially Clark and Lois) give the film emotional weight. Some pacing issues creep in toward the finale, and there’s a lot to juggle with supporting characters, but overall it’s a refreshing, fun reboot that honors the myth and feels worthy of the cape.

Score: 86% fresh (estimated) — a strong showing that suggests this new “Man of Tomorrow” era is off to a compelling start."
"Eric R","Sep 29, 2025","This felt like I was watching a sequel after skipping the first movie. The storyline relied on the hope that everyone watching was a devout DC comic fan. The direction and cinematography was amazing, but the storyline just skimmed through without delving deep into anything. It had some great moments which brought it to a good movie overall."
"BlckNMild","Sep 29, 2025","A new take on a classic and it hits. A1 Steak Sauce"
"Cheryl M","Sep 29, 2025","I watched Superman it was ok, the writing and story plot was barely average. The new Superman David Corenswet is good, I could get behind him. He will be a good future ongoing Superman."
"Rick P","Sep 29, 2025","Sorry, gave it a chance. Respect to eveyone involved with creating it, but it just does not work. Story is awful"
"Robert R","Sep 29, 2025","I really had a problem figuring out what they were going for. Tone kept shifting from trying to be funny to trying to be serious. I love Rachel Brosnahan but it really just felt like she was playing Ms. Maisel still."
"Brett H.","Sep 29, 2025","Overall I thought it was very entertaining.  Wish I’d have seen it in the theater."
"Brielle T.","Sep 29, 2025","This movie is pretty much perfection as far as I’m concerned. Characters are just how I imagined them to be, and the director somehow managed to make this movie feel like a Christopher Reeves Superman movie and a modern day action movie at the same time (I give most of the Christopher Reeves movie likeness credit to Lex. His actor made the character feel so evil that he was on the verge of being campy at times, and I mean that in a good way).

I do have one minor gripe with it that knocks it down half a star, but it’s only because I’m incredibly detail oriented and wanted a specific thing out of the story that would’ve made Clark’s character, in my opinion, better. But an action packed plot can’t deliver on everything, especially a little detail that happens during the climax. And, if you blink, you’ll miss it, so I won’t badger it too hard. Yeah. It’s a good movie. Which, at this point, probably comes at no shock to you. I’m looking forward to the sequel."
"Neagu M","Sep 29, 2025","Useless most boring superman movie i've seen. No substance no plot, trying to be funny with lame jokes( the scene with krypto and lex cmon)"
"Onetha W","Sep 29, 2025","absolutely incredible movie. James Gunn saved DC"
"Douglas H","Sep 29, 2025","I really wanted this to be a success. I grew up watching Christopher Reeve and the Superman original movies, which set a clear benchmark, but I've loved all the superman movies since with Brandon Routh and of course Henry Cavill.... until this one came along. I don't normally write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to in this instance, because it was just such a monumental disappointment and it delivered the worse possible attribute of any movie - a complete lack of emotion. I felt no joy, no sadness, no thrill - it was the most forgettable and emotionless superhero movie that I've ever watched. I didn't bond with any of the characters - there were too many of them and none of them had any real back story, so I was completely detached from all of them. Gunn is known for bringing fun and humour to his movies, which worked wonderfully well in the Marvel franchise, but failed miserably here. The script was awful and some of the characters just lacked any substance whatsoever - like Clark's parents or Hawkgirl, for example. The whole movie was just a 2 hour forgettable mess. And the notion that Superman was saving bloody squirrels and dogs whilst entire cities were being devastated with no human fatalities was just utter nonsense that is quite frankly insulting the intelligence of its audience. I know everyone reading this is thinking I'm a Snyderfan and just want him back. I don't - but honestly, ANYONE else would be better than Gunn. Please don't let him make any more Superman movies."
"CyBT 1","Sep 29, 2025","This movie genuinely made me feel like a kid again! I missed the magical feeling when I first watched the Christopher reeve movies and this film made me tear up a little bit when it ended! Call it nostalgia I don't care this movie is amazing definitely going to watch it again great job! SUPERMAN IS BACK!!!!!!!"
"Mia A.","Sep 29, 2025","Loved it. Sometimes DC can be dark, and that’s good when it’s meant to be. Man of steal had its own individuality to it. However this movie captures the young and vibrant feeling that comes with being first introduced to the Superman comics. Captures his own characters trials while still embodying the seriousness of the story. Enjoyed the humor, color and overall story telling. Not everything is perfect. But not everything needs to be."
"Dillon C","Sep 29, 2025","favorite of the year, DC is back"
"Linda H","Sep 29, 2025","One of the best movies I've seen and certainly the best Superman movie. David brings exactly what I've always wanted to see from Superman to the big screen. Batman has always been my favorite superhero due to his unwavering commitment to his beliefs and acting on what he knows is right. His compassion, kindness, morals, dignity, and ability to give even the worst of society fairness is more superhuman then most superheros. David brings this aspect back to Superman. Those were all true things for the Superman I knew growing up. It was nostalgic, and unbelievably touching. This movie makes me want to be a better person. I cried, laughed, gasped, and had a big goofy smile across my face several times. I will cherish all the warm and fuzzies I got watching this for the first time. I will cherish this Superman forever. David is Superman, the real Superman. The casting was incredible for this, I'm still in absolute awe. Its an emotional roller-coaster and the music is absolutely beautiful. The song that plays as he's rising from the dust of smashed building gave me chills. My favorite scene was absolutely the part where he was sitting outside talking with his dad. Also the scene where he was laid down on his childhood bed as his parents comforted him, there something so sweet about it. 
“I’m as human as anyone. I love, I get scared. I wake up every morning and despite not knowing what to do, l put one foot in front of the other and I try to make the best choices I can. I screw up all the time, but that is being human. And that’s my greatest strength.” - Superman"
"Spencer S","Sep 29, 2025","Truly the worst video I have ever seen. SUPERMAN (who is strong enough to bench press the weight of entire universes) was incredibly useless. He only saved a squirrel and 1 woman the entire movie. all of humanity (AND HIMSELF?!?!) believed a doctored video from the bad guy even though he has been saving humanity his whole life. horrible writing, not true to super man whatsoever, and zero justice for the bad guys. deplorable, truly. I hate whoever wrote this."
"Robert R.","Sep 29, 2025","Terrible. Egotistical heros with no resemblance to the actual heros. Just plain stupid."
"Kent M.","Sep 29, 2025","Worst Superman movie I’ve ever watched. One hour and a half hours into this mess and Superman is getting his beat in every way possible. And please James Gunn, stop trying to be funny. Just don’t think anyone has a good super hero movie in them. Please Stop!!"
"Li C.","Sep 29, 2025","Fun, light-hearted, unintentionally political but well meaning overall. Fits in line with Marvels current obsession with stuffing as much characters as possible, plus their interest in multi-dimensions. It’s something we’ve seen many times before but not with DC, so that was unique - for better or for worse. The main leads were likable."
"Julius R","Sep 28, 2025","Just didn't feel it maybe the actor who plays super man he just looks plain goofy looking can't take his face serious  ,but all around good movie"

"Kamil J","Sep 28, 2025","The era of superhero movies is well over.
I will get into heavy spoilers so be warned:

1. This has to be the dumbest Lex Luthor version I have seen. The whole plot is happening because he wants to create a country Luthoria and Superman is in his way...
2. He controls Superman's clone by screaming commands through a radio while the clone is fighting Superman. Commands like: 3B!!!! 1A!!!! And then clone executes those commands as ...special moves which Superman somehow can't keep up with.
3. Somehow Krypto is unable to follow a single command, joke that is funny first 2 times and gets sooooo overused that by the end it's more fun to watch paint dry.

And that's just few gripes...I'm not going to list them all here. I wasted 2h of my life on this...not gonna waste more.

It is commandable that they tried to make Superman more...light hearted...colorful...but what they should have focused on was good plot...and that was completly skipped."
"Carly R","Sep 28, 2025","The best superman film since Christopher Reeve's Superman. This was a great first outing, loved the cast. James Gunn put a lot of the weird and obscure DC elements in and it made the movie so unique and fun. Elements of the original score were here and there and helped the movie emotionally, though Gunn is great at creating emotional moments anyway. Fans have been begging for a long time - just make us care!! I really cared about the characters in this movie. And finally moving into the nowish future we got a super genius Lex Luthor who is scary! I can say I've never been scared or felt real stakes from a Lex Luthor character, and finally that mark was hit. 

All around great, no complaints, go see this if you haven't already"
"Angela P","Sep 28, 2025","What a wonderful watch! Thank you James Gunn for reigniting my love for the Superman franchise. I enjoyed eveey single minute, the film ticked all the boxes — strong, yet vulnerable Superman, Psychopathic Lex (although quite pitiable), bad superman, crypto and even Supergirl. Phew! I am looking forward to the next installment. All super hero movies should be directed by JG. Well done and David Corenswett was a great pick, sorry Cavill"

"Some R","Sep 28, 2025","Superman: 2025 delivered a hot pie of hope to my doorstep when I watched it. The visuals are amazing, and it feels like it was ripped straight out of a comic book. It gives Superman that Boy Scout feel that he’s lacked since the Richard Donner adaptations in 1978. It’s amazing how feel-good this movie is, and Superman is so… human. He’s so real and so charismatic and so kind to everyone and everything. It’s beautiful. Rachel Brosnahan also did an amazing job portraying Lois Lane, and gave her character the most justice ever seen on the big screen, same with Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor, though I can’t say I’m surprised. Beautiful movie, once again, James Gunn is a genius. Must-Watch."
"MaryAnn M.","Sep 28, 2025","Fun. Adventure and a cute dog"
"David A","Sep 28, 2025","There was talk of trying to get closer to the Christopher Reeves version of Superman. James Gunn didn’t even come close. Looked more like Mediocre Man. Too many other characters overshadowed the main character. The Richard Donner version still holds up better."
"Mark M","Sep 28, 2025","This movie is a complete disaster and an insult to the Superman legacy. It strips away everything that makes the character iconic and turns him into a weak, whiny shell of a hero. Instead of the powerful, awe-inspiring figure who stands for hope and strength, we’re left with a childish, ridiculous version that ruins the entire mythos. The story is nonsensical, the tone is juvenile, and every bit of “coolness” that Superman should have is completely absent. It doesn’t just miss the mark—it destroys it. If you value Superman as a character, avoid this movie at all costs."
"Razka M","Sep 28, 2025","this movie is so goated guys, believe me, this is the real superman.

ABSOLUTE CINEMA"
"Joel J","Sep 28, 2025","This movie was extremely disappointing, I’ve been hoping that DC could step up, but this screenplay is one of the most cheesiest I’ve ever had to endure. I’m sure the people who like this movie love Tyler Perry’s screenplays for all his shows. From Guardians of the Galaxy and Peacemaker to this rubbish? Cmon James Gunn!!!"
"RJ F","Sep 28, 2025","This was pretty bad. None of the characters were likeable nor were they developed well enough. We barely know their motivations. Half of them were thrown in there to make DC fanboys giddy. Metamorpho has a white girlfriend that he made an alien baby with? Huh?! I've never seen such an awful Green Lantern. The dialogue was pretty bad and campy and had none of the humor that James Gunn had with Guardians of the Galaxy. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner were a million times better as the Kents than the parents in this movie. The DC universe is a mess. Black Adam and Blue Beetle were much better and more watchable than this version of Superman."
"Beto Z.","Sep 28, 2025","Best superman on the big screen. Henry Cavils superman is nothing compared to David’s. I truly felt like a kid watching a superhero movie for the first time. It may have felt a little chaotic in some bits but it had a great deep meaning 9/10"
"Gail B","Sep 28, 2025","I liked Henry Cavill and I like this version too. I found this movie more easygoing and fun. Mr. Terrific stole the show. I wish this would have been a short streaming series instead, as 2 hours really isn't enough time to do the characters justice."
"Victor P","Sep 28, 2025","A decent movie, but not a great movie. Disappointed, James Gunn made him so vulnerable. To make him more human is one thing but he's too human now. Also to much salty language for a family movie. Graphics are OK. I expected more from this movie, especially since it's made a lot of money."
"Steve W","Sep 28, 2025","Terrible! Each scene feels like Stevie Wonder, and Ray Charles, wrote the script!! It's time to face a harsh truth: Superman just doesn't translate well from comic book to movie! Superman 2, from the 80's,  is the Best this franchise has been and will forever be in cinematic history!"
"Bob S","Sep 28, 2025","Incredibly stupid premise but the second half of the movie was better.  Hopefully the next one restores faith in the franchise"
"Tauhid J","Sep 28, 2025","This is by far the worst Superman I’ve ever seen in my entire life. I can’t believe they made him into a sissy. What a waste of my time."
"Craig C","Sep 28, 2025","Absolute worst superman of all time. please if you like the character of superman , for the love of god DON'T watch this film. It just isnt superman. If you enjoy the film fine, but just know this is a completely different person. This guy in the blue suit with a cape is a tiny whiney weak willed emotional mess. He has zero aura and gets beaten by absolutely everyone. he is the weakest of all heroes in this version of James Gunns superman. It destroys and character assassinates superman. I would give it negative 1000 stars if I could and erase the memory of having watched it. It makes me angry that someone was allowed to do this to superman."
"Steven B","Sep 28, 2025","It just wasn't Superman.   Also, the plot was very hectic and hard to follow.  I loved all the other Superman movies.  Just not this one."
"Furious B","Sep 28, 2025","Back to campy. While I appreciate a new direction from Cavill’s MoS here, there was some painfully cheesy cinematography and visuals. And Ma must’ve been from West Texas with that non-Kansan twang. Rented on Amazon for $7.99, that’s about all it is worth unless there’s some more Krypto footage in a directors cut."
"Jacob R","Sep 28, 2025","Best Superhero movie of 2025!!! This movie is entertaining funny and has action and has Heartwarming scenes. It was also so realistic they made me feel like i'm in the movie they knew what they were doing they knew what the audience wanted."
"Ian S","Sep 27, 2025","From watching the trailers, I did not think this Superman was worth watching, frankly it looked terrible. And after the first 5 minutes, I about stopped watching. Until I realized that this movie was a throwback to the original movie series and it was trying to be lighthearted and comedic, which if you give it a chance and stay within that mind frame, it is worth watching…! It isn’t great but it does a good enough job to be funny and interesting. The best line in the movie…” I am doing important stuff”… I liked it..!"
"James S.","Sep 27, 2025","James Gunn ruined Superman… yay… -_-"
"Dave V","Sep 27, 2025","What a H O R R I B L E  M O V I E ! ! ! More marvel like trash.  DC has hit rock bottom. The whole movie is a joke and insult to the previous Superman movies. I wasted 2 hours and 10 mins of my day. Don’t waste your time and ask for your money back."
"Ivan F","Sep 27, 2025","Is absolutely terrible. Please do not waste your time with this film"
"Marco K","Sep 27, 2025","Achei muito divertido, nao perdeu tempo com origem e trouxe uma divertida história de um jovem superman, aprovado."
"Aaron M","Sep 27, 2025","Did I watch the same movie as people giving this 5 stars?? I couldn’t take this movie seriously at all. Like some kids almost cartoon version with silly slap sticky characters. This movie was terrible."
"Leo B","Sep 27, 2025","This is definitely not a Superman who would be punching an armored clad Batman through buildings without a care for the damage. It was great to see a Superman connected to a larger universe, much more like the animated series and the comics, where life on other planets and intergalactic zoos are a thing. You can't have a hot girl and a Green lantern without that. It was definitely a fun ride"
"S J","Sep 27, 2025","Worst Superman movie I've ever seen (all of) although it probably had the best effects of them all. Really good looking movie (that's why I'm giving 2 stars and not only 1) but the parody Superman approach was awful in my opinion and it felt like watching a comedy with mostly bad acting but not funny at all. After the Guardians of the Galaxy movies which I loved I think it was odd for me James Gunn could make such a bad movie although it looks like most Americans loved it. I loved the ""Man of Steel Superman"" so it's not that I hate Superman but this movie was cringy in comparison. If you liked Man of Steel a lot I suggest you don't watch this movie at all and I only did watch it all because of the great cinematography and effects."
"L. M","Sep 27, 2025","Thank goodness for fast forward.  I’m watching it on BluRay (Thank you library),  i can’t blame the actors, but the storyline and such is an embarrassment to the Superman movie series.  First, he is not a meta human; stop calling him that.  Somehow Luthor magically creates an “ultra man” (no backstory) and a nanotechnology powered “engineer”.  I got as far as them strolling into the Fortress in Antarctica.  There is no real security; it just opened for Lex.  All the robots are destroyed, and the “engineer” connects, downloads, translates and walks away with the entire contents of his Krytonian computer.  Then the fast forward kicked in.  Social media manipulating human opinion, etc.  his own super friends turn on him.  Blah, blan blah.   Henry Cavill should thank the powers that be that he was replaced.

Question:  when they dove back into the atmosphere from space, what happened to the heat?

"Joshua Cabanillas","Sep 27, 2025","I thought it was pretty fine. I appreciate what it does as the cinematic genesis for this new Gods and Monsters DCU, but it definitely could've been way better. If they took time to flesh out more shots, color grading, music, etc. I mean it literally was rushed production wise because it was announced less than 2 yrs ago. Despite this the actors do a stupendous job. Mr Terrific in particular was so good.
He felt capable and almost robotic in a cool way which fits his character. Nathan Fillion as Guy was like he was playing a different person altogether from his usual roles. I will say I wish we got closure on the tension between him and Superman. I didn't like how Guy called him a wuss for caring about saving lives but then the movie doesn't pay that off. At least in Black Adam, (which this movie is very similar to), Hawkman and Adam got to square off their differences. I gotta say without Krypto this movie would be even worse. Most of the heart and soul is poured into the dog. Not that that's a bad thing but l'm not a fan of movies relying on the cute character in favor of character. Wasn't a fan of Baby Groot or Grogu much. I hope we see Streaky down the line, but SPOILERS mean we won't? Lex, Lois, and Kal were great. The actors were good as their characters. Not out of this world or anything, but just fine. Nicholas Hoult's take on Lex will win those who didn't like Jessie's take for sure. This just felt like a pilot of a show. I mean, even Smallville had a better pilot.
Also the character at the end telt like it could've been handled better. The villain reveal I mean. Feels like a lot of what happens in this movie is just to save it for later.
The MCU did this as well but at least they put the work in for each movie so that you can enjoy it as a whole experience and not a piece of a slice of a pie."
"David C.","Sep 27, 2025","Definitely a different brush stroke from the previous Superman. Unfortunately, I felt no real connection with any of the characters."
"Esau U","Sep 27, 2025","Me encantó la historia, los personajes y sobre todo un mejor lex luttor con la inteligencia y recursos para destruir a superman. Apegado más a los comics. Muy buena pelicula."

"Maicol B","Sep 27, 2025","es todo lo que superman alguna vez fue, la promesa incumplida, el cariño de un fan hecho cine, es cine señores"
"Yorel C","Sep 27, 2025","Thought the movie wanted to lean too heavy on a colorful Superman. The actor did a great job but overall...Superman lacked strenght/weight in using his powers. A lot ot shots looked weird, for instance, the close up shots when Superman is flying or when Hawkgirl got her close ups. 
They tried to hard to make the character a good guy. Krypto was the most annoying character in the movie and the Superman vs Lex storyline has been told far too many times. The only recent Superman vs Lex storyline that was interesting was in Superman & Lois. 
A for effort but execution was lacking."
"Sean G","Sep 27, 2025","Superman (2025) was honestly better than I expected and it was full of action shocking moments and some emotional scenes but the villains in this movie such as lex Luther will make your blood boil out of anger because of how cruel and out of control he is and him being the biggest Superman hater as well but overall glad the hero wins in the end because Superman truly is a hero symbol and he'll always be there to save the day and inspire kids to be like him too 👏 10/10"
"Jasmin A","Sep 27, 2025","I am seriously astounded that this is rated 83% this is easily one of the worst movies I have seen in the past 5 years. There is no plot, the movie starts in the middle of nowhere, there is 0 character development, it is all over the place, the graphics are trash and it is as if a 5 year old wrote the script. I am incredibly disappointed to have wasted even 1 hour watching that crap. 0/10"
"Addison J","Sep 27, 2025","What a pathetic challenge to the ethos of Superman movies. This version aims to mock, deconstruct and attack our culture. Alienating people through art has always made me question the intention. I get the mission here but poor execution. The allegories could be great if it was a different director and screenplay. This is such a weak attempt at rewriting Superman. Could've been so much better."
"Movie M","Sep 27, 2025","Really great movie. Loved the balance of action and comedy. The only unrealistic scene was when the “Boravia” army didn’t slaughter every innocent child, woman and man when they had the chance."
"Mayuresh S","Sep 27, 2025","Fantastic movie! Absolutely loved the style, theme and sequences. It was so fresh, emotional and fun. James Gunn nailed it!"
"Cristian s","Sep 27, 2025","No puedo ser imparcial cuando se trata de Superman así que obviamente me encanto. Ambientación perfecta y comiquera, llena de guiños que se notan fueron hechos con cariño. La esencia del personaje protagonista y lo que representa se transmite tal cual debería ser. Probablemente este sea el Lex Luthor mejor representado hasta ahora en el cine. Me encantaron los casting de todos los personajes del Daily Planet y de los Kent porque parecen salidos directamente de My Adventures With Superman. Si tengo que decir algo malo es que la historia es medio floja y en todo momento parece estar orientada hacia un publico infantil (pero eso tampoco tiene porque ser malo). Cumple, la disfrute y me genera esperanza con lo que puede surgir de acá en adelante."
"Shawn G","Sep 27, 2025","This movie is a giant steaming pile of crap."

"William A","Sep 27, 2025","I am watching this movie for the first time and I can't believe how awful it is compared to Justice League, Batman vs Superman, Man of Steel- these were so mich better than this...when did Green Lantern look like a guy that just came out of a bar after a 24 hour bender? This Superman movie portrays him like such a super weakling (im being nice, I wanted to say p*ssy)- For trying ti do a massive reboot and change, they should have animated it and made it Rated G...."
"Todd W","Sep 27, 2025","Felt like it was was aimed at grade 3 through 6 kids. Humor and plot was TV after school special with slightly better special effects?  Very disappointing."
"Daron  S","Sep 27, 2025","These critics must get paid to write nice things. This is one of the worst super hero movies in modern time. The entire movie is hokey and comical but never funny. The director made Superman weak, insecure and on top of that he turned his parents into ignorant hicks. Please don’t  waste your money."
"Izzy H","Sep 27, 2025","I thought this was supposed to be Superman’s comeback? Just found it so boring, took forever to end."
"A P","Sep 26, 2025","Filme HORRÍVEL 😕

"Jason C","Sep 26, 2025","Sorry, couldn't recommend it. Superman reinvented over and over, same as Batman."
"Jesse R","Sep 26, 2025","I cannot understand the positive reviews on this movie.

The plot was absurd and yet also so expected. There were too many quirky super hero characters. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the story concept was AI generated – nothing was unique or interesting, and it felt like uncreative audience pandering. 

I know many are upset at the movie for political reasons – I couldn't care about the political implications, I just thought it was worthless schlock."
"Garry A","Sep 26, 2025","I didn't care for the first half.  The second half was better, but not enough to redeem the movie for me.  Superman was over the top on saving everybody.  I thought he jumped the shark when he saved the squirrel.  He also came across as arrogant to me, especially in the beginning.  Mister terrific was my favorite character."
"Micky S","Sep 26, 2025","This movie is the stupidest superman movie i have ever seen. Literally turned it off after half an hour. Corniest crap ever. It is like a kids cartoon"
"Darth K","Sep 26, 2025","I don't know what movie everyone else was watching but I just thought this was so cheeseball.  Actually liked all the actors just fine in their roles.  And there were a few times the writing/jokes had me chuckle.  I think if Krypto and everything that had to do with him was cut out of the movie, it might improve my score by a full star."
"Dennis B","Sep 26, 2025","James Gunn no lo puede hacer todo bien. La película parece un monologo de un artista amateur, utilizando el ensayo y error, con el gran inconveniente de que ni un solo chiste entra. Es una montaña de emociones intentando ser una peli adulta en algunos momentos para acto seguido darte diálogos acorde a una pelicula dirigida a niños de 5 años. Los efectos especiales estan muy cuidados dando un claro ejemplo de como se puede hacer buen CGI sin que la escena sea nocturna. Como nuevo lienzo en blanco es un brochazo al aire, pero con el tiempo es posible que vaya cogiendo forma."
"Will F.","Sep 26, 2025","Was not sure what it wanted to be. Comedy, Political, Action? A soft Superman… no thanks. The dog backstory was more interesting."
"Carmen Adriana G","Sep 26, 2025","Fue una buena pelicula pero no la mejor del director como digo vale la pena verlo tiene personajes para nada olvidables la mejor lois que he visto y un superman que lucha por cosas que nos pasan a diario"
"Mark B","Sep 26, 2025","I thought it was awful. It was Shazam! (Which I enjoyed BTW) not Superman. It was dreadful, please bring back the old superhero comic characters not these flimsy ones. One superhero per Earth please. I thought Nicholas Hoult was the only Genuine Superhero in the film and he played Lex Luther beautifully."
"Levi A","Sep 26, 2025","James Gunn's obsession with trying turn to everything into GoTG is really getting on my nerve not just that he even copies sequences and ideas from his own movies shamelessly. This movie might just as well as be Black Adams 2 with how messy it is, It is just a compilation of scenes Gunn thought looked cool and put them together. As an animal lover myself I can't believe he even managed to make Krypto annoying too in this movie and let's not talk about the plot because there is none and the whole fake trend that this movie is about ""Hope"" was a lie everything about this movie was hopeless, Warner Bro will pay dearly for letting Gunn handle DCU it will eventually face the same fate as DCEU, goodbye."
"Joey M","Sep 26, 2025","The movie was interesting and not completely terrible. I’m glad I did not go to the theatre to watch it. However it’s a “if nothing else is on” I’ll watch it."
"Simon T","Sep 26, 2025","Oh my. For many years I stopped re-watching Mr Reeves Superman because of the very sad accident that happened to him. As with many people, the strength and determination he showed in his life was especially poignant given the iconic role he had played in the movie. When, a year or so I went back to the movie I could reflect on how brilliant was the movie and how brilliant Mr Reeves was in it. this is a movie that will be watched for generations to come.
I understand the challenge that the new movie faced. It could hardly be as good as the Richard Donner movie - Donner's movie had everything - a lightness of touch, a way of communicating a comic book feel on celluloid. A joy. I think it's also a testament to the movie that the Director's cut is pretty awful - the problem with the cut is that it extends a conversation Superman has with his Dad and it sits so badly in the movie. In the original cut we have a movie that is a great movie yet doesn't need to be be deep and meaningful - we can take joy from simplicity and fun and Superman - the original cut has oddles of that.
So when you remake what do you do? There's very few movies that manage to marry action and comedy as well as the original Superman (the only other one I can think of off the top of my head is Richard Lester's Three and Four Musketeers which has the same kind of joy and slapstick that Superman has. So comedy and action are a very difficult needle to thread.
So instead what the present Superman goes for is serious endeavour, weighty themes and angst and a deeper exploration of Lois and Clark/ Superman's relationship. In Richard Donner's movies what was interesting about the relationship with Clark and Lois and Superman and Lois was the sense that while Lois is really into Superman with Clark - not so much. For Clark/ Superman there's a lovely expansion of this when Clark tells Lana Lang that Superman can't turn she replies that she prefers spending time with him (Clark) anyway.
We get none of that in the present movie. I suspect what they were trying to go for was the idea of how would an alien be able to form a relationship with another species and negotiate a relationship. That could have been interesting but instead Superman/Clark in the present movie comes across as an emotioanally inaccessible person with anger management issues.
In another scene while other heroes are dealing with a baddie, Superman carries on talking to Lois - remember in the Donner movies Superman only ignores a cry for help because he has been infected and his evil side comes out. In the present movie he ignores a cry for help because - well I'm not quite sure - is this modern living - you may be a superhero but you have a relationship to deal with don't you know.
The acting isn't bad, you have to give them credit for playing their parts with such a dreary script (I supose as an actor you could hope that after taking the money you could feel more secure and hopefully in the future you won't have to do this kind of dross)
Oh and Nicholas Hoult is in it and it has to be said that any script that manages to make Mr Hoult look ordinary in an actor role should receive some kind of credit. Mr Hoult is one of the most interesting actors working today but it's criminal that such a talented actor has to work with material like this. None the less Mr Hoult and all the cast commit themselves admirably to their work - it's just a real shame that the script didn't justify the time and effort everyone was going to put in making this movie."
"Brian L","Sep 26, 2025","Of all the Superman movies that have been in the past, this new Superman movies really disappoints. Cheezy dialogue, cheezy graphics, some really stupid characters. Then we see all types of alien beings. Superman gets his butt kicked many times, so it didn't make sense as to why he wasn't as strong as we've known him to be. Then they create this universe pocket portal which really threw it into another direction. It was more like Superman meets Spaceballs while in a Dr. Strange multiverse. It got way too crazy and too stupid. Glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater!"
"Monica M","Sep 26, 2025","funnnn it was pretty good"
"Harry C","Sep 26, 2025","Meh. A nothing popcorn flick. Definitely not something worth watching at the cinema but it’s visually pleasing with a run of the mill storyline and decent acting. Nothing to rave about but that’s about as good as we get these days"

"Chris H","Sep 26, 2025","The character Superman was played perfectly.  The movie's 3rd act was noise and nonsense, which is all too common in modern CGI cartoons.  Overall, it was a fun movie."
"Sean F","Sep 26, 2025","It oscillates from pretty original and genuinely enjoyable to the corniest emotional porn imaginable but overall worth watching."
"Allyson P","Sep 26, 2025","so tired of so much arguing- we already have it in real life...."
"Christopher S","Sep 26, 2025","To say that this was an uninspiring take on an iconic character like Superman, is an understatement! Granted, it doesn't try to retell the origin story of Superman, which was appreciated. However, the plot seemed MISSING! I understand that this Superman was designed to be ""more human"" and less God-like but he spends almost all of the movie getting the brakes beat off of him by any and everybody!  He is unsure of himself, comes across as a pacifist who doesn’t want to hurt a fly, and his emotional arc is sort of laughable. David Corenswet’s casting for Superman was spot on, and I enjoyed the like comedic quirks that he brought to the film. 

However, this film tries to throw some half-baked, spoofed characters (Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Krypto, and even Supergirl) in that seem to be more powerful than the man of steel. The casting was COMPLETELY off for Lantern with an out of shape softball-dad with a really bad hairpiece! Why did Kent’s parents sound like they were some country bumkins from the bible belt rather than from Kansas? Hoult’s performance as Lex Luther was fantastic, but even he couldn’t save this film. Feels like a rushed job and I wouldn’t waste your time with this one. I feel sorry for those who don’t know the story of Superman because this film leaves you scratching your head and wondering why you would waste 2+hrs. Superman is definitely not the star of his own movie!"
"Steve E.","Sep 26, 2025","Even getting the shite beat out of him, Superman remains the greatest superhero."
"Bruce L","Sep 26, 2025","I guess I had high expectations of this movie, but it certainly wasn't what I expected - and not in a good way...

This movie was complex from the start - metahumans from other ""creations"" on planet earth with Superman not even demonstrating his ""super"" powers throughout most of the movie (getting his butt kicked most of the time) - it was an eclectic mix of a ""wanna-be"" superman with Green Lantern character and other strange metahumans who possessed forces of nanomites in what seemed like a messed up version of Dr. Strange's Multiverse movie. I couldn't make heads of tails of this - then there's the dog which was never in any previous superman movie before...

Then there's this other character who flies around in a virtual computer chair with monitors around him with the Lantern character - what?!....omg...

And the opening of the movie with Lois and Superman arguing in her apartment which was the most irritating to watch - it was worse than a soap opera and Superman engaged in it and even called people ""goons"" which he has never done in any previous movie before (it would be SO out of his character to do this) - WTF is going on?!

I give kudos to the creativity of this film, but I was greatly disappointed as this movie actually disrespected the character of this movie and the story/plot was just all over the place!"
"Hector Q.","Sep 26, 2025","Bad effects, it looks childish, you don’t see a serious movie"
"Bob B","Sep 25, 2025","This film completely missed the mark as a “reboot.” 
The plot was entirely over the top and extremely corny. The acting itself was lackluster and many of the characters lacked in delivery of dialogue. Overall, Superman was terribly cast and has little to no rewatch value. Hopefully DC gets it together and makes better choices for their superheroes moving forward."
"Gabriel KP. B","Sep 25, 2025","Las películas de superhéroes necesitaban algo así desde hace mucho. La vi en julio y escribo esto en septiembre, así que me atrevo a decir que es una pena que todos los medios de comunicación y el entretenimiento actuales trascienden como algodón de azúcar en agua. Personalmente, me encanta esta película. Gracias Gunn."
"Monica L","Sep 25, 2025","People are crazy to hate on this movie! This isn’t a “new take,” it’s actually more based on the comic books than the Henry Cavill and dare I say Christopher Reeves versions. I loved it and hope they do more. I believe each version has its place. After all, whether it’s the DC Universe or that ahem other one, each has multiverses, etc. So if you view the movie from that context instead of comparing apples and oranges you’ll realize how good and well done this one is."
"James H","Sep 25, 2025","Definitely different than I'm use to but a good movie just not crazy about the suit"
"James I","Sep 25, 2025","Let me start with David Corenswet as Superman... FANTASTIC. (I first saw him in Hollywood and commented that he'd make a great Superman) I love that he injects such a down-home sense of humor and humanity into the role. The film does this as well. It reminded me of when I would sit on my bed and read my early Superman comic books as a kid in the '60's. Superman is not just supposed to be heroic... he's also supposed to be FUN!."
"Joe N","Sep 25, 2025","Waste of time. Campy and goofy may be Guardians but not Superman. Not believable at all. Glad I never went to see this in theaters and watched it online without paying those prices. Would have asked for my money back."
"J T","Sep 25, 2025","Honestly this movie was bad. A 90% rating for this movie is insane. Would give it a 56%, max 62%. Man of Steel was a million times better, no comparison whatsoever, and that got a 75%. Seek help if you rated this a 90%."
"M G","Sep 25, 2025","Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen!"
"JP H","Sep 25, 2025","Sue me, I just didn’t like it. Too much of everything. And it’s the wrong type dog.  It’s trite, oh golly gee, gosh it is . Sup spends way too much of the movie getting beat up or making really Super corny statements about his love of humanity and doing good. 
The cartoons are better."
"Drew H","Sep 25, 2025","I had a hard time remembering much of this movie the day after I watched it. Fun at times but largely forgettable with characters I just can’t seem to care about."
"James J","Sep 25, 2025","Very weak. Not for me."
"Michari N.","Sep 25, 2025","A great start to a cinematic universe brings a fun and emotional ride."
"Theatre Queen D","Sep 25, 2025","This is truly the worst film I have ever paid to see. The performances are dreadful and all the CGI is so jarring it’s hard to watch.  There is no character development and not even any meaningful moral to take home. Awful. Don’t waste your time or your money. I cannot understand the high critic and audience rating - I have to assume it’s as fake as the CGI in the flick."
"Basho M","Sep 25, 2025","The actors can all act. The graphics are fine. The writing is so bad we nearly turned it off twice. This is what movies in 2025 are: completely schizophrenic, full of atrocious on the nose dialogue, weird messed up relationships, dream-like insane reactions and simply mentally messed up attitudes. The music is terrible and it had absolutely no heart."
"Cara D","Sep 25, 2025","Horrível apenas isso. Super herói fraco que não vence nenhum inimigo. Lex Luthor homem mais inteligente do planeta que fica chorando se leva hate na internet."
"Case J","Sep 25, 2025","SPECTACULAR! If you want to be taken away to wonderment, away from today's worry and strife, this is it. Mesmerizing from start to finish - fastest 2 hours ever. The best was how it left me feeling at the end - stronger, uplifted, something forgotten then regained about goodness in the world, a reminder that there really are good things, good people on Earth.  
This whole movie seemed a work of love, actors carefully chosen, detail, direction and writing, cgi, everything FANTASTIC. So many movies today seem catty, bitter, wry, dry, violent, demented or filled with negativity. This movie was different. As if symbolizing a paradigm shift, bringing back some forms of wholesomeness, morality, true justice in a pure and more forthright form. 
Loved the consideration for animals. Krypto was a total delight! 
The fighting was a bit much, but many will probably love the action, the depth of emotions, the dark and the light. 
Not only rented, but then bought it as well. A true re-watch over and over. Haha, also buying the other Superman movies too! Superman 1, II and Returns for SURE. This is one of the best movies EVER."
"Merrill N","Sep 25, 2025","A metahuman that never was. Just an insufferable tragic festival of boredom and failed masculinity. Poor Super Meta Human who is anything but Super."
"Joe c","Sep 25, 2025","1) they are TOTALLY LYING bout the rating of this movie.  Only ""verified audience members"" are counted which is BS.   Go look at ""all reviews"" to see what people really think. 

This Movie was a very ""James Gunn"" Movie.  It wasn't superman it was him trying to make Guardians of the Galaxy using superman and other DC properties.  It butchers the lore of Superman making him self-consciously obsessed with his public image and self righteous.  It makes is cousin Kara-El look like a drunk Gen Z alcoholic and don't get me started on Green Lantern and the ""Justice Gang"" They also exuded immaturity and pettiness... at times it felt like I was watching an episode of ""The Boys"" where it mocked or were parodies of the superheroes we grew up with vs accurate representations of them.  

Pretty much all previous superman renditions were better than this one.  No offense to the actor, but this was just a bad superman movie.  Good as a parody or mockery of the IP but not the noble heroic man of steel."
"Fardin S","Sep 25, 2025","It seems James Gunn knows how to handle lesser known characters. But when it comes to Big, Larger then Life, Iconic character like Superman, he failed."
"Andrew K","Sep 25, 2025","This was not only the best Superman movie, it was one of the best films in the superhero genre.  Not only highly engaging but truly inspiring… as a long time superhero movie fan, can’t recall the last time I felt so compelled… with that being said I don’t understand why Superman was not rated higher than Fantastic 4?"
"Adriana Z","Sep 25, 2025","Literally a very stupid and bad movie. So so so stupid. I hate superhero movies"
"Scott J","Sep 25, 2025","Absolutely horrible. By far the worst portrayed superman ever. Spits in the face of the character and every character they included (green lantern, hawkgirl, ect.). A massive waste of time and an insult to the entire super hero fan base."
"Ham B","Sep 25, 2025","Any review over one star on this complete piece of crap movie is fake. This movie is complete crap it is a reflection of the worst Hollywood has to offer."
"Bman L.","Sep 25, 2025","🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿"
"Emmas M","Sep 25, 2025","It was very fun to watch. I enjoyed all the characters and the dog was a very welcome addition. Well done and I know it must be difficult to create a new Superman movie with familiar people but I just became immersed in the story and found this movie fit the bill for being entertaining and enthralling."
"James G","Sep 25, 2025","This film crashes harder than Superman does in the beginning of the movie"
"Mostafa E.","Sep 25, 2025","Events are unbelievable and don’t draw a clear story"
"Piet P","Sep 25, 2025","A lot of potential but too much going on in one film and there isn't much structure, everything feels wonky...and superman (supposed to potry be stoicism) is extremely emotional. Suit 8.5/10  characters 8/10  story 5/10  superman himself 6/10 writing 4/10"
"Samir K","Sep 24, 2025","Kudos to James Gunn for reviving DC studios with this movie! This movie is not an origin story, but rather an ensemble movie of various DC characters being introduced to the audience as part of the DCU.
The visuals were stunning and each character had adequate screen time. Overall the movie was fast paced with no dull moment. My favorite character from the movie is Krypto!"
"Kyle c","Sep 24, 2025","If I was a 5yr old I might enjoy it. As a 50yr old it was the WORST Superman movie ever. Whole family hated it, best part was the dog."
"john w","Sep 24, 2025","Pretty sure this was a political movie. Also Superman’s a wimp who gets beat up until the end (real original) Their version of lex Luther was really good though"
"IRISH_308 M","Sep 24, 2025","Terrible! Not my Superman!!!! Jimmy should have stayed with Marvel/Guardian’s. He has ruin 1 of 2 super hero's I love from the DC world! He also ruined Henry Cavill’s character on the Witcher! Thanks JIM! Sad try.. and bringing super girl from the “WB” version drunk at the end was even worse. DC you failed again!"
"Annery N","Sep 24, 2025","Super hero movies are so back. Did not know what to expect but I was pleasently surprised."
"OJ S.","Sep 24, 2025","Amazing movie, so fun from start to finish. For all the walnuts claiming that “Superman isn’t strong enough”, did you really want another superhero movie where the hero is basically invincible and nothing is ever at stake? Also, Superman was incredibly strong in this movie. He flew into space while being dragged down by the Engineer and his literal clone. Also, he did that while having his body completely covered by nanobots and his lungs filled with nanobots. He then flies directly into the ground to kill Engineer and get them off of him. If that ain’t extreme strength, idk what is. Also, for anyone complaining about how hard his fights were with Ultraman, consider that Ultraman has identical powers to Superman and he’s controlled by a super-genius who has studied Superman’s every move and devised counter-moves for every situation. Frankly, it’s a miracle Superman was able to get out of that alive. 

Moral of the story, Superman was awesome and it was refreshing to see a superhero movie where the hero isn’t completely invicible and actually faces some adversity. 

Also, extra points for Punkrocker during the credits."
"Korey T","Sep 24, 2025","Wasn't the best but it's hard to follow Henrey! Could only make it about 40 mins in before I lost instrest but good actors."
"Rhys L","Sep 24, 2025","peak hopecore sigma movie"
"Alex D","Sep 24, 2025","Worse super hero move I ever seen."
"Mr. Steven W","Sep 24, 2025","This version of Superman was not what I expected. I do like DC universe. I grew up reading the comic books. But this one had a particular twist that was more humorous than action packed. The Superman that most people grew up with had incredible strength, hence the name Superman. This one seem incredibly weak compared to the Superman throughout other movies. It's geared towards an era where today's culture, social media are relevant to the movie. A lot of the scenes just seemed out of place. And the Green Lantern. Wow! What a disappointment, and Mr. Fantastic. What a horrible representation of these two characters who are really superheroes that had no real power or demonstration of their capabilities. Therefore, I couldn't enjoy the movie. I can only critique it throughout the entire time of me watching the movie and it's just seemed bad. Nicholas who played Lex Luthor excellent job!"
"Jeff B","Sep 24, 2025","This Superman story doesn't hold a candle compared to Superman: The Movie (1978). There is no character building - we are just thrown into these Metahuman's lives with no backstory at all. Somehow Mister Terrific sounds exactly like Robert Downey Jr's character in Tropic Thunder, which is hilarious considering that context. The trailers for this film were excellent, but the movie itself lacks everything needed to be taken seriously."
"Renier C","Sep 24, 2025","I regret buying this movie. It was so bad I could not finish watching it."
"Ima V","Sep 24, 2025","Wow.  After seeing the incredibly high rating, I'm questioning whether I can ever trust RT ratings again.  

I don't believe I've EVER stopped watching a mainstream, major studio, superhero movie but in full agreement with my wife, we stopped this one not 1/2 hour in.  

I made it past the silly setup they had to give to start where they started.  Not a big deal, Star Wars always does this.  I made it past the stupid ""super dog"" and the British robots.  I made it past the 15 second sun recharge and (barely) made it past The Boyz style, supposedly lab created super humans with flying, boomerang style saw blades in their hands and their goofy boss who had limitless tech and wealth but when they released a 2 foot high fire breathing Bowser (like the Super Mario boss) that grew to over 100 feet, I reached my limit.  

This is an insult to the franchise.  Truly pathetic.  How little is left of your taste and expectations if you actually enjoyed this.  Wow."
"D M","Sep 24, 2025","This was really bad.  I liked the actors, but the script was just stupid."
"Leo E","Sep 24, 2025","From the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, comes another great funny super hero movie with an emotional charge and beautiful cgi, James Gunn is setting up the stage for a great DC comeback or so I hope."
"Nikolas v","Sep 24, 2025","Oh my god....  I saw the first Christopher Reeves Superman movies at the cinema. I found the excitement of the introduction with Crypto again. Fan of the comics, fan of the cartoons, fan of hearing the music when Superman goes back into battle... wow, thank you. Super happy. Just one problem... Green Lantern and his team, well, especially him... it's totally out of the atmosphere and the film... we'll just forget that."
"Evan S.","Sep 24, 2025","In my opinion, they depicted Superman as a little weaker than most tv and movies. But A good movie overall. Love the casting for Mr. Terrific."
"Montana G","Sep 24, 2025","This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I'd rather stab my eyes than have to sit through this again. I truly don't understand how anyone could possibly recommend it"
"Alex B","Sep 24, 2025","Horrible Movie!!

They have destroyed the Superman franchise"
"Drew M","Sep 24, 2025","Guardians of the Galaxy starring Superman is fun at times. The tonal shift from the previous DC Universe works. Superman 'losing' a fight at the beginning didn't work for me. This is literally the only superhero where him being OP is what defines him."
"SSS Y","Sep 24, 2025","It completely lost me from the very beginning… and even worse the whole lot talking between Louise and Clark dragged so long if I was at the movie theater I would have just walked out. It was unnecessarily long and dull and boring. Please don’t make me hate this franchise."
