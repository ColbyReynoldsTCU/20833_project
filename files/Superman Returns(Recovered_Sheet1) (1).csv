10,"In the 28 known galaxies, there is no better film","I just caught a screener and am so blown away. The original came out when I was 6, so I have been a fanatic most of my life. I don't think the legacy of Superman has yet to leave any small boy unimpressed and forever moved to tell the truth, seek justice, and well, you know the rest.I will tell NOTHING of the story. It would rob you of everything good. Besides, I don't think there is anything I could write to make you not go see it. I just have to say that my hat is off to Bryan Singer for making so many important right choices. Sticking with the original John Williams score and having Ottman build from it, the re-working of Brando's archive footage, and most of all, the casting of Brandon Routh makes this such an amazingly familiar bridge from the 80's films with all thew wonder of what can be done with film today. All of the components that are necessary to accommodate your past feelings and emotions bridging them forward to this movie are present and in tact. Great job!!!! Let me say that I was on the fence about Routh from all of the trailers I had seen. I was so thankful that it was not Nicholas Cage donning the blue suit poised to ruin my childhood hero, but I wanted what seemed impossible, I wanted Christopher Reeve back in his prime heroic form. The trailers give no hint of the amazing performance that Brandon Routh has turned in. There are moments that just gutshot you right into Reeve's performances. The half cocked smile, the timbre of his voice, the Clark Kent mannerisms perfected by Reeve are echoed here in Routh's delivery as both an homage and as a great device to tie the past generation into this new ability to tell a story with all of the technology at hand.A big Kudos must go to Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey who are awesome as Lex and Kitty. Not too much humor, but some, not too much banter, but enough, and all of the evil you need to see in order to make him truly the enemy of Superman. Perfection! I know it'd be easier to enjoy if I just told you it sucked completely and didn't try to build it up to something you may not think it is, but I have no doubt about it. The story itself is too rich and wonderful and the trailers give away nothing of what's in store for you. There is no way to be disappointed. Take it from me.",435,441,davidsimmons,"Jun 17, 2006",

7,A different story on a classic superhero.,"Brandon Routh does pull it off as the new Clark Kent/Superman. This movie actually stands out from the crowd of comics turned into film (Batman Returns, Sin City, the Fantastic 4, The Hulk, Spiderman, X-men trilogy, etc.) Superman is a unique superhero. The context of his world is different from the corrupted (ba)Sin City or a world with millions of mutants. This allowed the film to have a lighter tone with a good amount of laughs.I didn't expect this film to be different or good for that matter but I loved it. Routh is our generation's Superman, Bosworth is a good Lois Lane, the effects are breathtaking, the story is exciting, and people literally cheered in the theater. Not to mention, Routh was so nice in person.",30,34,missportillo,"Jun 17, 2006",

10,The Man Of Steel is back....,"and from the looks of this movie and how much it will be making, I'm very sure he's back for good.On June 18th, 2006, I was one of the lucky 250 patrons who had an opportunity to watch a sneak preview showing of ""Superman Returns"" here in San Francisco, at the Sony/Loews Metreon theater.Don't worry. No spoilers. Just some small details.From the opening of the movie, fans who have seen the original film will be delighted at the fact that ""Superman Returns"" truly does feel as more of a 'continuation' from the original ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" starring Christopher Reeve. Even the opening credits will give the classic film fans a bite of nostalgia, simply because of the overall presentation of the opening credits.Director Bryan Singer really does know how to take these 'comic book based' movies to the next level and bring them success (or back from hiatus, depending on how you look at it) all while making the film watcher's experience something a bit different, not only in terms of plot, but his overall expertise and execution of being a really good director.Actor Brandon Routh definitely does extremely well in his performance as the main character ""Superman/Clark Kent"" and does so with such natural acting ability, you could have sworn that you've seen him act in many other things. (Yes, I really can see him as 'Superman') Actor Kevin Spacey's performance as ""Lex Luthor"", although not too derived from Gene Hackman's portrayal of the villain, does a great job at bringing a different kind of arrogance to the character. Then again, when has there never been a top notch performance from Spacey? All of the films he's starred in usually have him performing at his best.Actress Kate Bosworth's portrayal of ""Lois Lane"" wasn't bad, but wasn't great either and for some reason, seems a bit young to be the ""Lois Lane"" character that fans will remember through Margot Kidder's portrayal in the original Superman films from 1978 to 1987. Personally, I've always seen Lois Lane as a character in her early 30's, not as someone who is as young as Miss Bosworth is, although Bosworth's performance was just enough to be convincing.Overall, Superman Fans WILL be pleased by this 2 hour, 34 minute film that truly shows a triumphant return of the one and only ""Man Of Steel"".Would I pay to see it again? I plan on it. I'm actually planning on seeing it at the Imax Theater in 3D (select scenes in 3D), so why not? I'm sure I'll enjoy it again.",291,304,S_Forgel,"Jun 18, 2006",
7,This film does for Superman what Batman Begins did for Batman.,"Of all the Superheroes, my favorite has always been Batman and Spiderman,along with the X-men.Because, I have something to relate to with those characters.And they really can exist in real life.Superman has always been my least favorite,not because he is flawed or anything,which he is a bit,it's because he can't exist in real life.But there's something in him that relates to us,as a human.He is lost and doesn't know what to do.He lost his parents,he is confused and he doesn't know what choices to make,and yet he chooses to do what he does.He is a being from another world,and far superior.He lives among us as a friendly human being.And protects us with the power he has.I've always loved Superman for who he is ,but the not the overall character.But after watching this film, I saw something in him that makes him real.People look up at him and consider him god,and their Saviour.He gives hope to people ,he is different from them,and yet he chose to protect them.But deep inside him there is humanity hidden.And this film explodes with warmth and thrills.It comes close to beating Batman Begins and Spider-Man films,and this film completely expresses the essence of this Legendary Character.He was the first of its kind.I can't praise this film enough without spoiling a bit,but I'll try to give you nothing but the praises.I liked the first Superman film,it was one of the first great Superhero films to reign the big screen.It was the greatest superhero film of its time.Even if it looks outdated in its effects and technology,it still retains the charm and sweetness that makes Superman so likable.It was massively entertaining,and still is.But for me,it's now a bit cheesy and cartoonish and lacks a classic villain that Luthor was supposed to be.But Superman:The movie remains to be the first great classic ,like the comic book itself.Last year, we had a reinvention or re-imagination of Batman in Batman Begins.He returned to the screen in a miraculously fascinating way.The character was made riveting and more complex,and the true essence of the character was brought in that film,which makes it the definite Batman Film.Superman Returns follows the same League.This return is nothing but a welcome return.It gives you the very definite version of who Superman really was and is in the comic books and more. The story is so humane, and so close to your heart that you accept Superman for who he is and you feel for his love that he lost.This film is close to the first.You know the story ,and there are big surprises ,so there's no point of mentioning them and I think you should go see it for yourself.The effects were breath stopping along with its action. You will have your eyes fixed at the screen and grip your seat so that you won't even move. This is the best effects 21st century has to offer yet.But to be honest it's still not superior than King Kong.The SFX just stays behind that film.But it is unlike anything you'll see all year,in particular the Plane Rescue sequence.Although,they're nothing Groundbreaking,or remotely as earth-shattering as King Kong.That was the best Special FX 21st century had to offer.The action in this film is filled with so much energy,sheer enthusiasm and excitement that you feel like you're flying right up there with him. Kudos for its SFX .But it's not a film that solely relies on its SFX,it has very little of those and minimized action.Instead it focuses on the story and character like Spider-Man films did.I hated Singer for leaving one of my favorite comic book films and did this.But he has brought so much warmth and love to this film that this is more of a love story of regret than an action film.And for that this man deserves all the praise.From Usual suspects to X-men films, he's always presented his vision in a different manner.The true hero here is Singer himself and I think if he had helled X3,it could've been a far better film than it is.This film propels and brings Superman where he belongs.The original Superman was enjoyable and fun.And it's mainly because Reeve's presence,who brings so much humanity and humour in the character and the film that you simply love the Hero.Here ,it's not Reeves or Brandon Routh,who resembles a lot to Reeves, that make this film more than what it is in comparison to performances. The whole film belongs to Spacey,I'm sorry Routh ,you resemble a lot to Reeves and you were great, but it's Spacey that really has the acting skills.He simply turns Luthor into simply evil character that was rather silly in the original film.Spacey shows who Luthor really is,which was missing in the original film. Routh fits so well as the Man of Steel that you have no complaints towards him.Kate Bosworth as the Love of the steel that melts him whenever he's close to her disappoints.She was lost mostly and too wooden as Lois Lane.Parker Posey is another special mention and so was the rest of the cast,especially Marsden.There are numerous references to the Richard Donner classic.And that just brings you to remember that film.It's as if you're watching that film with more improved quality of effects and looks.And that is both a good thing and a bad thing.Way too many Jesus references in the end.I would say this was a terrific and groundbreaking achievement.Although I would still consider Spiderman 2 my favorite superhero film followed by X-men films,not the third one,and Batman Begins.Then comes this, beating Hulk.This is an exhilarating epic.Superman Returns is an ambitious work.Filled with momentum excitement.Tremendous ,marvellous epic scaled entertainment.It was good but just not great.Its last few reels were disappointing and the surprise it had for us just disjointed the whole story.You can feel the powers that Superman possess but they don't have a lasting impact.Only Pirates will tell how long Superman lasts.",39,51,HiddenVoice,"Jun 19, 2006",
10,greatest super hero film ever,"Brandon Routh perfectly portrays both Clark Kent and superman.. the former's endearing awkwardness and the more confident and suave superman. he is the rock that the rest of the movie is built upon. he actually improves upon Christopher Reeves performance. Kevin Spacey is also great as the psychotic lex luthor. although his evil schemes are never really explained very well, his performance makes up for it. the film is beautifully shot and edited, its a sensory thrill ride the whole way through. overall, this might contend for greatest comic book film ever- even better than last years Batman Begins, partly because this has a believable and engaging romance- not the travesty that was Katie Holmes. spot on casting, great acting, and great directing from Bryan Singer make this an all around winner.",26,31,mct1115,"Jun 20, 2006",

8,one of the best Super Hero movies ever,"This movie completely blows any of the recent superhero movies out of the water. Spiderman, fantastic four and even singer's previous X-men movies all pale in comparison. Not only does it include incredible special effects, sound, and visual achievements, but the plot is well developed and deeper than most comic/super hero movies ever attempt to go. Superman Returns stays faithful to the original Superman movies and comics and serves as a great update to the storyline. Brandon Routh must be a distant relative of Christopher Reeves, the similarity between the two and their portrayal is striking. Bonus points go to Singer for including Brando clips for Superman's father.In my opinion, a good superhero movie should make the audience want to live in the world which the hero inhabits, or wish that the hero truly existed in reality. This movie does just that- makes you wish there was such a force of truth and justice living in our world.",161,169,jpetsy07,"Jun 22, 2006",
,dull and slightly embarrassing to watch,"The real problem here still lies with the fact that Director Bryan Singer vastly misjudged what made the first Superman so successful. He actually seems to think that people care about the characters' relationships and the metaphysical plot. Everyone I've spoken to thought those two things were the weakest aspects of the movie. The first Superman was good DESPITE the corny love story and beyond corny plot turns. This one centers on corny and centers on the mundane, and that's why it's dull and slightly embarrassing to watch. It's either that or maybe it's the ridiculous Superman costume that they modernized. Maybe they should've changed the movie's title from Superman Returns to Brokeback Superdude? It's no wonder Bryan Singer recently said the following about this movie… Reflecting on how Superman differs from his previous movies, Singer observed, ""The one thing I could say (about that) is the romantic nature of this film. This is different than my 'X-Men' films. It could be called my first chick flick. It's a kind of modern romance in a way played out by very nostalgic characters."" Nostalgic or simply played out?",29,31,dododingo123,"Jun 22, 2006",
5,"Very disappointing, a soap opera with a bit of action thrown in.","I just saw Superman Returns at the world premiere in Westwood. I have been a Superman comic fan since I was a kid (I'm 49 now) and I still watch Smallville. Superman – the character – is the greatest, but this movie was…extremely disappointing. Knowing the director was Bryan Singer, who just did X-Men, I was expecting an action-packed thriller. This movie was more a soap opera with special effects and some action thrown in out of obligation.One of the best parts of a hero-bad guy movie is when the two adversaries meet to duke it out. About 80% into the movie they finally met, and the scene was pitiful. Lex Luthor is famous for being an evil genius. In this movie, he was just evil, but he was very well played by Kevin Spacey. Lex is supposed to use his genius to do battle with Superman. Design a super strong robot armor suit, or some other clever tactic. You can guess how Lex dealt with Superman, the most predictable way possible. Superman is back after being gone for 5 years. He went to find Krypton, which maybe wasn't completely destroyed. (This is not a spoiler). But FYI, Krypton was bathed by the radiation from a red sun. People living there were normal, like us. They only develop super powers here on Earth due to our yellow sun. So, even if Superman tried to fly to Krypton, he would lose all of his powers and die in space when he got close to the red sun. Other gripes: Superman had so much make-up on, at times he looked computer-generated. 'Clark' looked way too much like Superman. Christopher Reeve did a much better job as a slouchy, meek Clark. Brandon Routh might be handsome, but he just looked sooooooo... darn young. How could such a baby-face be a ""Super Man?""What I liked: James Marsden playing Perry White's nephew, he was awesome. Great guy, great character, great role. It was cool seeing X-Man Scott Summers without his glasses. Frank Langella...very small role, but great job as Perry White. Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen...funny, funny guy. Without him, this movie would have been absolutely humorless.Did these guys show this movie to a test audience? I would love to know how they spent so much money to make such a long and mostly boring movie.",10,11,drbryan,"Jun 22, 2006",
8,"Wow, just amazing","I saw an advance screening of this today, and had to write and say that Superman Returns was amazing.Brandon Routh as Superman is awesome, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is amazing and Kate Bosworth, just great as Lois Lane. Even the musical score is really powerful... Bryan Singer should be running all Hero based movies...Great Story, Great Acting, Great effects, probably one of the best movies I've ever seen, I was really overcome with emotion during a couple of scenes...and I was glued to my seat for 2.5 hours... after it was done I wanted to run back in and see it again.Get out of your chair, and go see this movie...now...",31,32,Fingers-4,"Jun 23, 2006",
5,"Pointless to hate, meaningless to love","It's been nearly 20 years since the last SUPERMAN movie, and that one -- SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE -- was such a low-tech, silly muddle that it doesn't even seem fair to count it among the first two. (SUPERMAN III was nearly as bad.) Yet somehow, the Man of Steel has kept his place in our hearts. Who does have at least a curiosity about how the new film, SUPERMAN RETURNS, will fare? Certain the special effects have advanced considerably since the 1978's original tagline promised us ""you will believe a man can fly."" And here, you do. The FX are great and convincing. But... what else? Does it deliver? The answer is a mix of ""yes"" and ""no."" SUPERMAN RETURNS, as much as Clark Kent himself, seems to have a split personality. Is it a sequel (as much of its dialogue and title suggest) or a remake (as its style and plot choices indicate)? Well, it's a little of both, and in that conflict lies both its fatal flaw and its salvation. The storyline and tone so closely mirror the original -- especially in the comic flair exhibited by Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, predictably delicious) and his relationship with ditzy cohort Kitty (Parker Posey). Superman (Brandon Routh, who often appears to have been extruded from a solid piece of manhunk)has been missing for five years and suddenly returns to earth to continue doing good deeds (why he left and why he returns never really make a lot of sense). Meanwhile, Luthor has a plan for world domination that includes, once again, a giant land-grab (even the 1978 jokes about this are recycled). Back at the Daily Planet, Clark continues to pine for Lois (Kate Bosworth), who still can't spell. Then there's Jimmy Olsen, Perry White, Ma Kent -- all the usual suspects. Lois has a boyfriend and a son, too, which is one of the few changes from where we last saw them.There's so much the same that to speak ill of the film is somehow to dishonor its predecessors. But there was a lot of room for director Bryan Singer to improve and reinvent the story, not feel beholden to another 30-year-old movie. But his efforts smack of folly. There are a fair number of moments to enjoy in SUPERMAN RETURNS, but they require an unusual amount of pretending not to notice the obvious. Does it bother anyone else that a 23-year-old (Bosworth, who looks all of... 23) was THE famous Lois Lane -- the same one who Margot Kidder portrayed at 30) when she was 18 years old? (The story makes numerous references to the first two films, including the ""My Night With Superman"" article that we are now meant o believe was written before Lois could vote.) Or that a 26-year-old (Routh) left the earth at an age when he would still be considered SuperBOY? Or that Lois' son -- who, in the time line, has to be no more than four -- looks to be at least six? Doesn't this all strike you as Hollywood at its franchise-minded worst? At more than 2.5 hours, SUPERMAN RETURNS doesn't need to be as long as it is, and would have benefited immeasurably from a tighter script. But as an entertainment, there have been worse. It's just this one could have been much better.",13,15,awjonesjr,"Jun 23, 2006",

9,Fantastic,"Let me cut to the chase by paraphrasing the Superman ad campaign: You *will* believe that Brandon Routh can fly. I'm jealous of him because he was born to play this role. His Clark Kent is goofy and endearing; his Superman is invincible and inspiring. I have great respect for Bryan Singer, and congratulations to him for all the work he put into finding his Kal-El; without such an archetypal lead, the rest of the movie would have been irrelevant. I'm baffled as to why they don't have more of Clark and Superman speaking in the trailers for the movie. I think a marketing exec somewhere must have been worried about people saying ""But it's not Christopher Reeve""...But that was unnecessary; anyone who thinks that going in will forget it by the time they leave. There are a few parts of the storyline that I'm not happy with; they're meant to bring human dilemmas to Superman, but instead they drag him down into the mundane. However, I forgave most of that when he repeats some of Jor-El's words at the end of the movie. Finally, I'm amazed at Singer's ability to tell such an epic story with almost no on screen violence and death...This is a movie I can't wait to watch with my daughter - she's only 2, but I won't have to wait long...",5,6,johnny_go_time,"Jun 23, 2006",

,Superman Lives!,"Saw an advance screening yesterday...Brandon Routh pulled it off beautifully. He resembles Christopher Reeve's Superman so much it's uncanny. The first time he smiles as Clark Kent, back at work at the daily Planet, it felt like it was Christopher Reeve again.Kevin Spacey is an excellent Lex Luthor. His role was written much better than Hackman's role in the original films. He didn't seem to be coming up with plans that could only work under comic book logic. Admittedly, they could only work in Superman's comic book universe, (Fortress of Solitude, Krypton, Kryptonite, etc.) but the logic of his plan is sound. His character's obsession with real estate resembles Hackman's Lex, but Spacey's Lex is a much less silly version of the role. Hackman is a great actor, but his Lex Luthor was very badly written, IMHO. Nobody could have saved it.The effects were great, the story was great, the acting was overall very good. There were, however, numerous errors in the reality of real things. The end of the scene involving the Mustang (no spoilers here) defies the reality of cars, as an example. Sure it's not the first time a Superman movie, or indeed any comic book adaptation, has made these type of errors, but it would have been better if they did little things like that right, instead of using the ""Eh, it's just a movie"" excuse.Ultimately, I loved this film. It's a great story well told. It doesn't need to be anything else.",96,105,crobarj1,"Jun 24, 2006",
,It's Nothing New but It IS Dull and Flat.,"Like bad action movies of the past with a big budget but no brain, (Can you say Reloaded? Can you say Revolutions? Can you now say Returns?) This movie pretended to be smart but ultimately there was no thought put into the writing. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. Besides, the one thing those Matrix sequels mentioned above did right was showing off Superman like powers and flying abilities. So, Superman Returns offers NOTHING new.A serious disappointment here.",15,17,McGrit,"Jun 24, 2006",
9,An Immortal Hero,"Superman ReturnsSuperman is my new hero. His sense of justice is so well defined that just the idea of Superman makes people behave. They open doors for each other. They say ""Thank you"" and ""Pardon me."" Why? Superman is the model for how to act. But it is Kal-El's kindness and respect, his undying belief in family values that make me wish he really did exist. Superman behaves as we all can…and should. So it is with the visual experience Superman Returns offers: his world is super-realistic. The FX didn't make me think ""That's fake;"" the effects made me think ""I want to live there. I want to live in Superman's world…right now."" Superman Returns is the first feature film to be shot entirely with the new Sony/Panavision Genesis camera system. This 70mm high definition digital camera was worth every penny of the $209 million dollar budget that was spent on it. From the opening titles to the end credits the clarity of the film makes for absolutely seamless transition between reality and magic. Superman has never looked better.Director Bryan Singer took on the daunting task of resurrecting post-Christopher Reeve Superman. Imagine making an Indiana Jones sequel without Stephen Spielberg and after Harrison Ford was paralyzed and then died. First, you have audience expectations which are off the chart. Second, you have essential elements such as Kryptonite, Jor-El, Lex Luther, Lois Lane, and The Daily Planet newspaper that must be introduced in a way that will inform new viewers while not boring loyalists. Third, you have to advance the series with an original yet respectful story line. It is like asking someone to thread five needles at the same time. This seemingly impossible task was accepted by the young Bryan Singer, who made a name for himself directing 1995's The Usual Suspects. He followed with Apt Pupil (1998) and X-Men, X2 (2000, 2003). If you consider that this Superman sequel has been in development for Bryan Singer's entire career then you get some idea of what a potential trap he was walking into. Now that the dust has settled and Superman Returns is a reality, Singer definitely accomplished what few thought possible: he resurrected a hero.The story picks up where it was left after Superman II (1980). Kal-El has gone on a mission to visit what is left of his home planet of Krypton. Unfortunately, we do not get join Kal-El on this journey, but that is just one of the few objectionable decisions made by screenwriters Dan Harris & Michael Dougherty. Their picture is a tremendously entertaining one that accomplished an extraordinarily difficult task of satisfying everyone from the critics to the 13 year old who wants to fly. Kal-El returns home after five years to a changed world. Superman is compelled to protect earthlings from each other.Superman loyalists can breathe a sigh of relief. The fact another Superman sequel is slated for 2009 is proof that the Man of Steel is here to stay. Singer dedicated Superman Returns to Christopher and Dana Reeve, but everyone should embrace Superman's focused pursuit of justice. The question ""Is Superman needed?"" plays a large role in the movie as well as in real life. To both, the answer is Yes.Grade ASuperman Returns Cast: Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey Director: Bryan Singer MPAA Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 157 minutes Release Company: Warner Brothers",9,14,mrw8,"Jun 24, 2006",

7,This is not an ordinary movie,"This is not an ordinary movie. What we are dealing with here is the embodiment of truth and justice (the American Way has been upgraded to the World Stage). Superman is not just any Comic Book Hero... he is the quintessential Super Hero. Fun and Campy throughout this was enjoyable and action packed with great CGI at the start leveling to crystalline structures later that lacked veracity. You can take a break in the movie at the 3/4 point when there is an excess of the water structures and you will come back refreshed to finish the 2 hour 30 minutes (including about 7 minutes of Credits at the end).The new Superman is Brandon Routh, who is relatively free of a past of major roles that may have prevented us from believing him to be Superman. I don't watch much TV, especially the situation shows on the networks and those were his credits before this Superman. Fortuately, he was born in Iowa which is pretty close to the Kansas of the Kents, so his accent is right on. Kate Bosworth steals the show, however, as she has much more display of depth of emotion than Routh as Superman. Kevin Spacey is good as Lex Luther, but we still are looking at him in this movie and thinking it the character is Keven Spacy.",3,9,imdb-larryxl,"Jun 24, 2006",

The special effects were nearly flawless, Routh both channelled Christopher Reeve and made the part his own, Spacey owned and Bosworth did a much better job than I thought she would. Singer really laid a solid base for continuing adventures that I hope will be even bigger and better.

10,Superman Returns! The movie in which Superman returns!,"Superman Returns! The movie in which Superman returns! He doesn't get a very warm welcome though… As always there are plenty of bad guys lining up to shoot at Superman! And as always they seem to think that even if their first 16 bullets have bounced harmlessly of his chest the 17th might be the one to miraculously kill him. It might seem pretty stupid for them to behave in this way, but I guess if they were smarter they probably wouldn't have chosen to live a life of crime in the only city in the world that has its own near-omnipresent godlike guardian. Now we all know that in the kingdom of bad men, the bald-headed bad man is king, so it's no surprise to see Lex Luthor up to his old, bald, tricks. Like all bald men, Lex Luthor is a bitter, evil, sinister, malevolent, twisted monster, but unlike your ordinary bald man, Luthor is also intelligent. Baldness and intelligence? - A deadly combination! And Luthor uses every ounce of his evil genius and every inch of his shimmering bald head to pester our hero at every turn! Superman is good-looking, strong, beloved by people everywhere and on top of all that (quite literally!) he has a wonderfully thick and lustrous head of hair! For ladies everywhere (and some men), he really is the full package. It's not hard to see why Lex would be jealous of Superman's package. There are photographs of it thrusting out at him from his morning newspaper everyday. It could even be argued that Superman should bear some of the blame for Luthor's behaviour; he's well aware of the impact that his package can have, and he does insist on rubbing it in Lex's face on a regular basis. It strikes me that Superman has a lot in common with a certain other character. A benevolent stranger sent from above who possesses incredible powers and a heart filled with nothing but love for all mankind, who finds himself persecuted by a handful of small-minded human beings. Someone who many people have devoted their entire lives to worshipping and following his teachings… Someone who has had a major influence on my own life and seen me through some pretty tough times, our Lord and saviour - E.T: The Extra Terrestrial. Unlike E.T though, Superman has the peculiar stroke of luck to fly halfway across the galaxy and land on an alien world only to find that it is populated by people who look exactly like him! What are the odds! There will be no dressing up as an old woman, hiding in wardrobes or fingering small children for Superman! The Superman project has had more than its fair share of controversy. I've even heard people complaining that Superman's 'S' wasn't big enough1 I actually thought that they were saying that his 'ass' wasn't big enough. I thought that the obese citizens of the USA were rising up in protest about the fact that there are very few fat superheroes. Then I realised - they probably can't 'rise up' for about anything! Except maybe to waddle down to McDonalds for another Big Mac! Ha ha ha! Fatties! Anyway nerds, put your nerdish minds at ease and rest assured that Bryan Singer has given Superman's S, and his ass, plenty of thought. He made the right choice with the S, and in the end he had his way with Superman's ass too. You might disagree with what he did, but you've got to admire his determination! Almost every big-name director in Hollywood has been linked to some kind of Superman project in recent years, with all sorts of wacky ideas up for consideration. An ugly Superman? It nearly happened - Tim Burton had plans to make a Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage as some sort of sullen, hunchbacked incarnation of the hero. It's kind of a shame that the we never got to see that version, because Nicholas Cage is obviously a huge Superman-fan. At least he's been given the chance to play the lead in the upcoming Ghost Rider film, so he's still grimly hanging on to the superhero ladder, even if he's only on the bottom rung and other actors keep stepping on his face as they clamber past him to box office success. What about a Superman film directed by Kevin Smith? Jay and Silent Bob Vs Superman! Just imagine, two hours of Superman talking to Jimmy Olsen about Star Wars! With Ben Affleck as Superman! And Jennifer Lopez as Lois Lane (renamed Lois Lopez at the actress's insistence! What a movie that could have been! Or how about Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Superman? When Superman is betrayed by his best friend Judas Olsen, he finds himself arrested and mercilessly tortured by Pontius Lexus! After being krypto-whipped to within an inch of his life, Superman is sentenced to death and forced to carry a glowing green kryptonite cross to the top of the hill where he will be crucified. And all the while a distraught Lois Magda-Lane is forced to stand helplessly by and watch the terrible injustice unfold. Harrowing.In summary, Bryan Singer abandoned his beloved X-men in the blink of an eye when the chance to direct Superman came along, and it's not hard to see why! Like any other red-blooded male, Bryan would much rather be behind Superman, putting everything he has into The Man Of Steel rather than doing the same to some anonymous leather clad man with a hairy back. All we can do is sit back and watch Bryan do what he does best… and it's quite a site to behold!www.chipremington.com - the movie review website that's better than a medium-to-hard poke in the eye",11,27,ChipRemington,"Jun 25, 2006",
10,A Nutshell Review: Superman Returns,"Superman returns! And in a style befitting a worldwide pop cultural icon easily recognizable from that distinctively red-yellow S-shield. Being stuck in production hell for almost 2 decades since the last movie installment, Bryan Singer has resurrected the Man of Steel for the silver screen, with an all new cast made up of fresh faces and veterans, even Marlon Brando, as Jor-El.In the hands of lesser directors, it will be tempting to make a Superman movie consisting of mindless slugfests, capitalizing Supes' invulnerability. Early drafts of a new Superman movie wanted to do just that. In the hands of unimaginative storytellers, this same invulnerability will also prove to be a bane, and therefore translate into a bore. Singer, based on his track record of his successful X-Men movies, in massaging multiple favourite characters and telling a compelling story, weaves his brand of magic into Superman, giving us not only what everyone would come to expect, but also an extremely important factor that makes this movie a winner - He humanized Superman. It's no easy feat, but he pulled it off wonderfully.Being the last son of Krypton, sent here like a messiah with powers to conquer, it is too easy to dismiss him as a boy scout on a mission to save the world from evil doers and natural disasters, and take for granted that he does what he does, because he can. Singer worked plenty of emotions into Clark, as well as Superman, in feeling the isolation of an alien in an adopted home, in always trying to pretend to be what he's not. You feel his pain that despite being around his loved ones, he will never able to always be there for them, because of his higher calling. There are scenes which makes you feel just that - Here's Superman, but OK, now that you're safe and sound, he has to go wrap things up, see you around later. A man yearning to shut out the outside world for quality time, but not being able to do so, for who he is.For someone invulnerable, Singer worked into the story, moments where his invulnerability wanes. And I tell you, even the most stoic critic of Superman, will feel pain and anger when that happens. It's as if Superman was a fellow human being, and seeing him subjected to the cruelties of nasty human thugs, just makes the blood inside you boil. You want to help, but obviously can't since it's just a movie. But you feel just that way.Brandon Routh, a relative unknown, filled the shoes well as the new Clark Kent/Superman. He bore some resemblance to the late Christopher Reeve, and at times even sounded like a youthful version of Reeve too. He did a commendable job in not being over-awed in a role which is under constant spotlight, and he is believable both as the Man of Steel, and as the bumbling Clark. I believe Routh will win fans approval worldwide for his portrayal, and it should endear him as another definitive cinematic Superman. I like the continuation of that bit through conversation that Superman doesn't lie.Kate Bosworth too did a great job continuing the film version of the tough as cookie Lois Lane, though here the character has mellowed somewhat because she's a mommy now. And it's always the little things that count, that she still smokes, still is a klutz at times, and an extremely nice touch to progress from the first two Reeve-Kidder Superman movies, she finally won her Pulitzer Prize, although it was for her story which stung with a criticism on why the world doesn't need Superman. (Look out for that explicit jibe about the Oscars too).And not to forget, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, criminal mastermind. Brain over brawn. It's interesting that Superman's greatest enemy has always been Lex, a mere human, but with a desire to eliminate Superman, and here, Lex wastes no time by lapsing into mindless monologues when going one up against our hero. Spacey's Lex is slightly different from Gene Hackman's, in that this one had a little more comedic flavour, though not always intentional. Spacey hams it up a bit, and made it somewhat scary - you'll never know what is going on inside his bald head. And there are some scenes which just crack you up at times, like the gig with the toothbrush (shan't say more).Lex's scenes were slow to begin with, but builds up into a megalomaniac's plot to become a landlord, again tipping the hat and staying true to the Hackman version. That means that there is no LexCorp, but that's just a minor upset. His array of wigs and headpieces are also included, and his female companion in Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey) brought back shades of Eve Teschmacher from the 1978 movie, in having a thing for Superman and humanity in general. In reference to the earlier movies, Superman's ability to see through lies was also mentioned, and it worked into Lex's brainchild of an idea in having Kowalski put up as a sort of bait.Plenty of nice performances from the supporting characters, like X-Men's Cyclops James Marsden (does he hold the honour of starring in superhero movies from Marvel and Dc?) as Richard White, the Superman alternative of a man who can always be there for you, the family man with no cares of the outside world other than his own family, and Frank Langella bringing veteran clout as Daily Planet's Chief Editor Perry White. Sam Huttington's Jimmy Olsen was a natural too, rounding up our Planet's crew.Singer's Superman might just bring all fans out in the open, and declare that yes, that's the Man of Steel whom we have been so familiar with, taking his rightful place amongst the better cinematic versions of other superhero movies.",8,12,DICK STEEL,"Jun 25, 2006",
9,Better than the original,"For a minute there, I thought I saw Christopher Reeve in Brandon Routh, the new Superman, and he wasn't even born when the original came out.""Superman Returns"" capitalizes on special effects that the original could not even imagine, almost thirty years ago. The story line is more over the top than the original, too. At first, I was wondering if I was going to like it, but it grew on me.For those of us who got to see the original TV series, there are occasional nods to it in lines in the script, which made me laugh out loud. The others around me never got the joke because they were too young to have seen it.Routh is excellent, as is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey. however, is deliciously great as Lex Luthor. A great job indeed. He enjoyed making this movie.I wavered between 7 and 9 for this movie as I was watching it, and settled on 9 for the inside jokes as homage to the original TV series and the superb performances by the central characters.",3,7,forhall,"Jun 25, 2006",

6,Average Portrayal,"I agree with the previous reviews that the movie was shot beautifully and the special effects in this age of movie making was far beyond the previous Superman movies. However, the cast seemed a little uncomfortable with each other and a few catch phrases were overused. The comic delivery and expression for some of the funnier parts in the movie were spot on and Kevin Spacey portrayed Lex Luthor(comic-book, not Smallville version) perfectly. Brandon Routh was a decent Superman, but not even close to Christopher Reeves when it comes to believing him as an actual person/superhero. A previous review said it was better then Batman Begins and I have to strongly disagree, because the pairing of Chris Nolan and his ability to portray twisted darkness, and Christian Bale who can portray a schizo very well(American Psycho) was perfect. If you love the Superman story and have followed it through the ages, this is a movie to love, but if you aren't familiar with the previous Superman movies, it seems to drag and will not leave a good taste in your mouth.",13,15,skubast3v3,"Jun 26, 2006",
,Superman Returns triumphs over all other versions.,"""Any defeat, however trivial, may be fatal to a savior of the plain people. They never admire a messiah with a bloody nose."" H.L. Mencken I've always thought of myself like Superman: heroic, above the crowd, strong, selfless. The new film Superman Returns reveals that HE is just like ME: weak, self absorbed, righteous, mortal, and wobbly about women. The numerous spot-on insights in this latest installment are testimony that this film may even eclipse the best of Spiderman in exploring the effect being human has on the best of us.At a recent Hollywood party, I lost my hand for a second in a shake with Mike Tyson, the flawed former heavyweight champion of the world. I did speculate, however, that I had never before met someone who was once the best in the world. Superman (Brandon Routh), unarguably the best of us all, is the polar opposite to Tyson, but both are reduced from their lofty cultural thrones because they are not above acting foolish like the rest of us.Although not of our planet, Superman exhibits human vulnerability when he faces Lois's (Kate Bosworth) having a child (This kid is unworldly strong. Could the Man of Steel have acted like a real man that night?), and boyfriend but not husband (Hmm, what's she waiting for? a cape?). All happened when and, maybe because, Superman left for five years to find what was left of Krypton, the source of his only physical weakness, kryptonite.Director Bryan Singer brilliantly bandies about Superman's struggles with Lois and his combat with nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), who has kryptonite and cave crystals from Superman's Fortress of Solitude to neutralize Superman and start a new continent on earth. Superman's skirmish with death at Luthor's hand has to be tough on an audience that sees its savior as immortal.The difference in special effects alone between this version and the first in 1978 (expertly directed by Richard Donner) is dramatic: Superman now flies like Baryshnikov, and the universe, from the titles on, looks as real as a night at the Palomar Observatory.But it is in the human struggle that Superman Returns triumphs over all other versions. It makes me think again about the messianic Christ motif and the notion that men, such as Lois's boyfriend, struggle with the idealized superman in the sub consciences of the women they love.Even Lex Luthor loses that battle.",3,12,JohnDeSando,"Jun 26, 2006",

9,Nostalgia reins supreme in Superman Returns,"I relived my youth on the weekend. Superman Returns was amazing. Rich in colour. The story was strong with some comedy thrown in to keep it light. The world needs Superman and I'm glad the franchise has been reborn. It's a great first installment, and if this is any measure of what's to come, we're in for a great ride. Brandon Routh does a great job playing Clarke Kent and Superman. Kevin Spacey is a great Lex Luthor. The supporting characters were well cast. Metropolis hasn't looked this good, ever. ...credit to Sydney. The special effects are amazing, and it all adds up to a great movie. Only a few scenes could have been cut, but a terrific effort from Bryan Singer. X-Men's loss, Superman's gain!",0,5,cookj1,"Jun 26, 2006",
9,"Great film, but still flawed","I finally got to see Superman Returns last night. Keep in mind, however, that I grew up with the Donner films as a child, was and still am a big fan of the comics, and even wrote my undergraduate thesis on Superman. So I tend to view the character and the franchise with rose-tinted glasses.That being said, with the exception of Reeve's absence, I think Superman Returns trumps the Donner films in almost every way possible. I know, blasphemy, but true.Gone, for the most part at least, is the camp and the self-aware, winking-at-the-audience moments of the previous Superman Films. Like the first two X-Men, singer plays it straight with his hero, and rarely slips into parody. The film's visual style is also quite surreal, which is also a hallmark of Singer. Like New York in the Spiderman films, Metropolis is very much a real American city, but with subtle differences that lets the audience know this may seem like real life, but it's not. It's a world where a man can fly and lift cars over his head...oh, and where shuttle launches happen over major metropolitan areas! The writing is a bit crisper. The music-less bombastic, more subtle. But what about the performances? Kevin Spacey is by far a better Luthor than Hackman, who I contend was terribly miscast. Like the film, Spacey's Luthor lands somewhere between complete fantasy and real life. He's equal parts zany, over-the-top villain and meglomaniacal entrepreneur (much like Phillip Seymour Hoffman in MI:3). Bozworth holds her own as Lois Lane, but not enough to make you forget Margot Kidder. And Routh...well I'm a tad conflicted.I'll be honest in my assessment that I think Routh is a better Superman than Reeve. Reeve's Superman does everything so effortlessly, with little to no uncertainty or strain whatsoever. Routh's take is much different, and far more interesting. There's a grimace on Routh's face when he lifts something heavy. And when Superman lifts something as heavy as I don't know...say an island...it really takes its toll on him. Routh's Superman is one who's a bit more vulnerable, less certain of himself, and definitely more realistic.That beings said, Routh is a terrible Clark Kent. His interpretation of Clark is an abysmal, half-assed attempt at a Reeve impersonation. Reeve's Kent was a very socially awkward, bumbling man..but still a grown-up and a consummate professional. While he lacked grace, he was still a competent, confident reporter. Routh's Clark Kent is a man-child, completely inept and slow in every way possible (though this could be the writer's fault as well as Routh's). In a scene where Clark, Richard, Jimmy, Lois and her son are burning the midnight oil to meet a deadline, Clark comes across as the retarded older son of Richard and Lois, especially in one shot where a portion of beef burrito is hanging out of Clark's mouth.All together, this film is great, and what I believe to be the definitive version of Superman on film, or at least the Superman of my generation (I wasn't born until shortly after the third installment of the original movies). The film has flaws that's for sure, but like Batman Begins, it's got a bevy of awesome scenes and enough heart and soul to compensate for them. Things could've been a whole lot worse. Brett Ratner could've directed it.",0,5,brown301,"Jun 26, 2006",
8,Fab - really loved it,"I won tickets to the World Premiere and the after-show party to see this. Wasn't convinced that I would enjoy it but I loved it! Kevin Spacey was pure evil - the darkest Lex Luthor yet. And the new boy? Didn't he do well!! Hard act to follow but he came out unbloodied and creditable. I think people will find it hard to accept him at first - but he will win through.The film itself was amusing and definitely different enough to keep us on the edge of our seats. There were parts that made us laugh out loud, which is exactly how a Comic Book Movie should be.Go and see it. Enjoy!",1,4,amandawithmintsauce,"Jun 26, 2006",
8,"Very good film, Not the best comic version ever.","I went for a screening last night with my co-workers to see a screening of superman returns and I must say it was a great movie. The plot and casting for the movie is good, but could have been great is singer would have put more depth into the film, like having Lois and superman actual have a relationship in the film and not hinting that they were (together) in the past. Also I thought there should have been more action in the movie for it being 154 Min's. I was surprised to see that Lex Luther played by Kevin Spacey lived up the personification of evil in stealing ever thing and planning he needed to lure out superman. He was a great lex Luther, but I still like Gene Hackman as lex. Also the added of Lois husband Richard White played by James Marsden was bad casting and acting on his part.The visual effects were amazing and almost as good as the Spiderman movies , but sometimes they look to cheesy like when superman is laying in the solar system and speeding around the earth. The movie should get an Oscar nomination for the score by John Ottman and the special effects award because god knows they spent enough money on it.The casting for superman was very well thought out because they needed an actor who didn't look to old, wasn't a big Hollywood star and wasn't bad at obtaining the necessary look and acting skill it takes to play superman. They found Brandon Ruth who is a great pick for superman. Also Kate Bosworth plays a respectable and intelligent Lois lane. The adding of Marlon Bando from archive footage was great because it gave the people who haven't seen the first superman movie in 1978, to experience Jor-le as superman's father and not adding him in a way that would'nt look to be repulsively and cheesy. Superman's mom Eva Marie Saint was a great choice as well.In all the Supreman Returns movie delivers another great story of the man of steel and a chance for millions of people to see him again in a new light, crafted wonderfully by Bryan Singer and company.",1,9,stradecl,"Jun 26, 2006",
8,"Excellent, yet.... something's not quite clicking...","I was as excited for this as anyone was, and I was not let down for the most part. The action sequences are some of the best in recent years and the special effects help too. Brandon Routhe does a fantastic job as Superman and Singer proves yet again he's brilliant when it comes to choosing the right people to play beloved characters (Jackman as Wolverine). Kevin Spacey does a decent job (not amazing but still quite good) as a Lex Luthor, but I do feel as if he tried to make him into something more comical than he should have. The score is something else, too. Amazing seems like the right word. Yet, I walked out of the movie feeling as if something just didn't quite click with me. I loved everything but there was just something that it didn't have. I have to compare it to other recent comic books and have to put Spider-Man 2 as the best. I can't say it's as good because it seems to change its attitude about halfway through the movie. Maybe it was me but I definitely recommend this film to EVERYONE.",0,3,heyuguys1988,"Jun 26, 2006",

It is like you would write a text all in bold just to smash the attention. And I don't want to be misinterpreted , I don't want to suggest the ""Superman Returns"" is exceeding in violence by horror or tragedy.Is just you are waking up in a movie which seems like an Arcade Action Game.I'm not saying that the movie is bad or that this type of approach is not suitable for this type of movie, I just want to conclude that lately this seems to be the whole idea of many movies (Poseidon, Ultraviolet, ...) and it seams that the strategy is still working and the producers make big money with this one.Hmm, maybe the computer games are pushing the line far and far...",2,2,mortexu,"Jun 26, 2006",
6,The Superman Movie I've Always Wanted,"I am an avid Superman fan (comics, TV, movies.) The Superman mythology means to me more than it means to a lot of other people and I've never really been able to put a finger on why exactly that is until recently. Having grown up with a physical deformity (microtia on my right ear) I have always known what it was like to feel different, to feel like an outcast. My parents always told me that it wasn't how I looked (in Superman's case, where he came from) that would define who I was on the inside or how I could affect other people's lives. Superman is an outcast. He is different. That's how and why I identified with the character and clung to him for dear life my entire childhood. The Christopher Reeve films were my escape growing up. I loved them with all my heart and still do to this day. Between 'Superman 2' and today we really only had bits and pieces of Superman to wet our whistle but nothing that ever captured the essence of the character as well as the original films. 'Lois and Clark' was campy and 'Smallville' only gives us Clark Kent, not Superman. When the first words of 'Superman Returns' were written about on the net long ago, I knew that this would be THE MOVIE. The movie that would define movies for me. A character that I had always been interested in, a passionate director, and passionate writers and actors attached to the film. I grew impatient as I constantly read about and watched video blogs on the production of the film. I saw the teaser trailer on the head of 'Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire' and as soon as those classic words from Marlon Brando rang out: 'Even though you've been raised as a human being, you're not one of them' , I was moved to tears. The full trailers only made me more excited to see the movie and finally last night, I got to see it and yes......it was everything that I had been waiting for. An intense love story between Superman and Lois Lane. Clark Kent longing to be cared for like his alter ego is throughout the world. Lex Luthor back and badder than ever. And conflict in the Superman character that no one has ever seen before. Bryan Singer has given me the greatest gift I've ever gotten, a Superman movie with a heart and soul. This film is terrific in every way, shape and form. Acting, directing, photography, special effects, music. It's all there and at the end, I was left with a feeling of fulfillment yet I still wanted more. Superman is back and he is still relevant in today's world of 'bad ass', vengeance driven, dark heroes. Yes my friends, he is back and it looks like he'll be here for a lot longer than he already has.",1,6,Neo-166,"Jun 26, 2006",
2,Superbore,"Having seen it last night I have to say I was grossly disappointed. This movie is booooorrrrriinngah!! Brandon Routh makes an okay Superman looks and sounds wise it's just watching the movie is like watching sap drip from a tree. It's all about pacing. You can make a 3 hour movie feel like an hour an a half. This movie felt like Dune the 4 hour version except no where near as intriguing or complex or good. This movie cost 350 million to make and is in major trouble after this weekend as people yawn there way out of the movie theaters to go tell their friends who are waiting for the crowds to die down not to bother or to wait for DVD. Be one of the those friends and save 15 dollars!! The Problems: Kevin Spacey is playing John Doe from Seven mixed with Verbal Kent. He doesn't make the role his own. He is no real danger for Superman. You know the outcome. The movie, scene by scene, is predictable. Lois Lane has no personality nor does anyone else. Everyone seems bored including Superman,..oh and everyone who is watching the movie.I truly believe this is Bryan Singer's analogous coming out of the closet movie.

1,Good Lord ... this movie is terrible,"There are three or so truly great sequences ... truly great.But, overall ... the thing is abominable. Superman (for the most part) and Perry (throughout) are understated and believable (I'd like to see both reprise their roles under a different creative team) ... but the rest of the cast is abysmal: Spacey is a scene-chewing twister ham, Parker Posey is an insipidly anachronistic plot device, Lois is a wooden cipher/six-grader-at-dress-rehearsal, Jimmy is an annoying twit, etc., etc.The plotting is juvenile, convenient and way-too-predictable; the CGI is unimaginative, muddy and way-too-obvious; the music is desperate, cliché and way-too-obtrusive.

It brought me back to the first time I saw Superman at the drive inn almost thirty years ago. The only thing that could have been left out was Parker Posey as Kitty, or at least less in the film of her would have been better. Spacey was an excellent Luthor. Singer's story was well worth the wait. The special effects for this movie were the best that I have seen on film since Star Wars Episode III. The tag line for the original Superman was ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"". Well the new Superman only fortifies that position with the special effects laid out in this film.

Amazing special effects that seemed to have all the ""Block buster"" elements rolled into one. Brandon does an amazing job as the ""Man Of Steel""(I might add he is genuinely good hearted off camera too), very believable and well done. Kevin is the kind of villain you love, but hate as well. Truly evil and yet hilariously complex. Kate does a good job as Lois Lane, though not as fiery as I would have expected. Her performance is very believable and engaging.

1,Not very good at all.,"As someone who really liked Superman I and II (II more than the original)and thought Superman III was OK in certain parts, Superman Returns has too many problems and may be below Superman III, It was 2 1/2 hours, but the time moved along to me, it didn't seem to drag. The problem for me is in the story. It's too disjointed, the editing and story itself just had me saying ""huh?"" too many times.You can tell they edited out a lot of stuff, especially at the very beginning of the film and the farm scenes. Also at various times of the film it seemed like they made weird cuts and that messes with the flow or sense of it.Bryan Singer said he loved Superman. It didn't show in this script. Kind of a weak story.Brandon Routh is OK. Sometimes he looks like a CGI figure. Kate Bosworth is OK too, but I kept thinking of Margot Kidder's Lois and saying she's too young since this happened 5 years after II.All in all, I give it two thumbs down. Sorry to say. Just doesn't deliver. All the hype and waiting fails to pay off.",21,23,nativecodder,"Jun 26, 2006",
10,Superb,"After reading some of the reviews about superman returns, I want to ask a question. Did you guys see the same movie as I saw? Because I loved it. It is definitely the movie of the summer. It has all the ingredients a superhero movie must have. I agree that Batman begins and spider man 2 were great movies but you really can't compare it to those movies because they are both different superhero movies. Superman returns is a great movie both technically and commercially. All of you who haven't seen it yet watch it with an open mind and you will love it.My Rating 10/10",3,4,dhruvdude,"Jun 26, 2006",
8,The Man of Steel is back!!!!...and hopefully for two more films!!,"I have been a Superman fan since I was a child...and growing up watching the movies in the 1980's, I was impressed...well, at least until Superman III and Superman IV. After seeing those horrible sequels I thought that there was no hope for the Superman franchise. However, I am here to say that there is hope..and that hope lies in the latest installment..Superman Returns. This movie was very entertaining..both visual effects and plot. The acting was great and new comer Brandon Routh filled the man of steel's boots very well. If you've been reading or listening to all the ""Superman is gay"" crap that has been floating around the internet..you've just been wasting your time. It's not true. I don't won't to give away the plot details, but trust me...Superman is far from gay. I really enjoyed this film. It made me feel like a little kid again. It definitely shows the human side of Superman through society's eyes in today's time. I hope you will all enjoy the film as much as I did!",0,1,cbhammo82,"Jun 26, 2006",
10,"The single greatest embodiment of what Superman is all about, and one of the greatest films ever made.","Being a lifelong, passionate Superman fan, as well as a great admirer of the original Superman films, I personally could not wait until the release of this new chapter in the saga. That said, it should not come as a great surprise that a couple of friends of mine and I went to see Returns as soon as was possible, and were fortunate enough to catch a 10:00 p.m. show time the night before the official release. And I, I who went in with such lofty expectations, was blown away with film. Simply blown away.This film represents what it really means to be Superman; why Superman is not only the greatest superhero yet conceived (or will ever be conceived), but the single greatest human concept ever conceived; and this film is immensely enjoyable: it is, cinematograpghically, beautiful; the special effects are flawless; the musical score is unforgettable; and the story is both timeless and unique in both its simplicity and its complexity. The casting was expertly done; Brandon Routh could quite easily pass for Christopher Reeves' younger brother, and Kevin Spacey is brilliant in a role that Gene Hackman nailed nearly three decades ago. All said and done, the film is perfect, or at least as perfect as any film really can be.Superman is a character who embodies everything that is great about mankind, which is uniquely ironic, considering that the character himself is not a human at all. Here is a character that was sent to Earth with nearly limitless powers, but with no real incentive to use them for the betterment of society. Despite that, though, Superman does contribute to society, using his powers for good, for the preservation of truth and justice, two of the most ingenious human philosophies ever conceived, just because this is the right thing to do. In a way Superman is a Nietzschean entity; indeed, his name comes from Nietzsche's own concept of the Uebermensch, the man who casts down traditional societal labels of good and evil to do what he knows is the right thing to do. And he is a sort of Robin Hood-esquire entity, helping those weaker than himself just because he knows that it's right to do this; Superman is the penultimate paragon of altruism, and for that reason alone he is the greatest of characters conceived by humans.Superman Returns demonstrates what it means to be Superman; what Superman means to society; what Superman means to you and me; and it does this all in an amazingly beautiful manner. Indeed, if you see one film this year, or, I'd wager to say, the next several years, see Superman Returns. See Superman Returns, and admire it for its beauty, for its plot, for its unforgettable characters, and then, after that, think about what it means to be Superman, and what Superman has to teach us all about ourselves, about society, about the world, and about everything else. See Superman Returns, and be a better human for it.",4,5,RenaissanceMan42,"Jun 26, 2006",

8,"If Spiderman 2 is a 10 and Batman and Robin is a 1, this is an 8","Of the recent superhero movies, this was pretty darn good.I hold Batman Begins in the same category as the Punisher. These are movies where the special effects aren't a big deal, but the action itself is.Superman Returns is much like the Spiderman movies. Spiderman 2 is the gold standard in my opinion. (Spiderman 3 preview was great) The special effects are a major part and there is a love story. The effects were really good, love story...eh...could've been more with Clark and Lois. Thats the good stuff, not Lois and Superman.Oh, how about Cyclops himself being in this for most of the movie? Spacey was respectable as Lex Luther. Parker Posey was good in her role as well as Kal Penn, Kumar himself.

5,a film that risks for greatness but doesn't fly high,"I can't say that I'm very much the Superman fan, at least in comparison to some other superheroes that I'm interested in. The whole saga and the like just never seemed all that compelling. But on the other hand, as films, the first two (more really the first one) were rather well done pieces of solid, Hollywood entertainment. While I wouldn't want this review to have to keep comparing to the Richard Donner film, certain things did strike me just on Superman Returns' own terms. Director Bryan Singer has proved with his first two X-Men films that he's not ignorant in the ways of making compelling comic-book entertainment. But here he's got a bigger bill to fill here in terms of making a good enough script (er, one with as much fun as intelligence for the audience), and a cast, aside from the plethora of special effects and visuals at his huge-budget disposal. I wish I could just turn off my mind and just take in everything as it went. As I walked out my friend asked me 'well, what did you expect?' Not much, actually, but that much wasn't even filled to what could have been.It's a bit frustrating too to come across a blockbuster like Superman Returns, because you can sometimes feel the ambition that Singer and his crew and cast are going for. And Singer does provide some interesting, sharp visuals at times. And, as well, sometimes he doesn't. In terms of just action-movie terms it is very well shot most of the way, and fans of the Superman lineage looking for a fresh 21st century feel might be impressed. But, unfortunately, Singer's own ambitions become part of the film's drawbacks. Arguably, the film's near two hour and forty minute running time is overdoing it, and despite the information that the script requires in the last several minutes, one too many an ending is delivered. Certain smaller scenes showcasing, more or less to decent effect, Superman's overwhelming ability to do (predictably) anything to serve and protect at all costs, are also not really needed. And the basic concept at root in the film, even in the 'must-suspend-disbelief' world, is a little tough to swallow. Without revealing too much, under comic-book movie logic it falls a little, well, flat.Now, some of this could go by the wayside if the cast was at the best of abilities, or at least with the correct parts. I wasn't expecting another Christopher Reeve, of course, but it was hard for me to see what Singer saw (aside from his apparent liking of his connection to Clark Kent's awkward/bumbling in Brandon Routh exactly. He gives off a quality of being more wooden and bland than can even be stood considering the man of steel's impervious ""human"" qualities. Kate Bosworth does what she can, though only so much due to what her somewhat conflicted role requires. A couple of supporting actors are also a little disappointing from Frank Langella and James Marsden. And surprising still is Kevin Spacey, who only occasionally sparks up the kind of appeal that went with his past villain roles. So, in a way, maybe it just all added up to something that worked against what I was going into the film for- it is not bad on the side of technical astuteness and finesse. But that part has to come up against a script with some rough, scatter-shot patches, and a other elements that practically drag the film into a sluggish pace.All of this, however, will be moot for the legions of Superman fans, I would say it would be worth checking out the film at least once on the big screen. But for the non-fans or just the casual moviegoer, I'd say if you do proceed know it might not be the big summer smash that's been hyped to no end for over a month.

7,Good - not great.,"Like he did with most movie buffs, Bryan Singer first attracted my attention with ""The Usual Suspects."" The film had some directorial flaws that some of its die-hard fans occasionally tend to overlook - but it revealed true promise in its director.""X-Men"" was the next step forward - the comeback (or revolution) that comic book movies needed. Today, we've had a string of successful adaptations - ""Spider-Man"" 1 & 2, ""Batman Begins"" - but ""X-Men"" was coming only a few years after ""Batman & Robin"" had proved the genre dead. Singer resurrected it.""X-Men 2"" was even better - deeper, darker, and more mature. So when I read that McG had been bumped from the new ""Superman"" and the directorial reigns had been handed over to Singer, I was thrilled.Unfortunately, the end result didn't quite meet my expectations.I have never really been a fan of the original ""Superman"" movies - or even the character at all, really. You should bear that in mind while reading my review. I don't read comic books, but I am familiar with the more popular characters, and I have always cherished Batman the most because he's a regular human - with no special powers - trying to do good in the world. He uses his anger not to cause more pain, but to serve justice. Christopher Nolan channeled this superbly in ""Batman Begins"" - the dark fury of the character - and Singer tries to channel a similar ""dark side"" to Superman here, but it doesn't really work. It betrays the more lighthearted moments of the movie, and probably the biggest flaw of all is this: when you have an (almost) flawless guy like Superman as your main character in a movie, it's going to be hard trying to get everyone to relate.Singer is smart by trying to expose Superman's (or, really, Clark Kent's) romantic struggles - it shows the nerdy side of Clark: the awkward, fumbling man who wants so desperately to find approval for who he _really_ is in the eyes of his one true love, Lois Lane - but finds she has fallen for his alter ego, the macho Superman. This concept is the strongest element of Singer's film. Critics who have complained that the film is too heavy on romance are missing the point. How exciting would it be to see two hours of Superman - almost invincible - running around being destroyed by nothing before finally, at the end, meeting a true challenge in Lex Luther? The tender human side of this film is what elevates it above the other ""Superman"" movies, but there is still only so far you can go, because Clark isn't human. There's a classic oxymoron in the name ""Superman"": as his father (archived Marlon Brando footage) told him, he is not ""one of them."" He is not a man. He's super, all right. But he isn't a super man.Is this movie good? Yes. Will it please the die-hard Superman fans? Fans of the comics - perhaps. Fans of the original film series - probably not. It's much darker, longer and less humorous (although it still has plenty of comedic moments).I walked away from the film feeling fairly disappointed, simply because for a film that is over two and a half hours long and has so many moments that approach excellence (and even manage to channel the directorial influence of Stanley Kubrick, for goodness sake!), it never quite makes it into the realm of ""Spider-Man,"" ""Batman Begins"" or even ""X-Men."" It's a bit of a step backwards for Singer - he seems overwhelmed with the big budget (his opening twenty minutes or so are really, really messy and had audience members in my screening asking what was happening - it's a bit too vague and random), and having to work with past material. It may have been easier for him - based on what he has achieved in the past - to merely start the series over a la ""Batman Begins"" and separate his project from the previous ""Superman"" universe.I admire what Singer has done here, in parts, but I think it's easy to see that the $200 million drove him to his brink - he's better working with more intimate productions.I'd recommend this film because it _does_ have some breathtaking moments. But I think with some better editing it could have been cut down to a smooth two hours or so - but even then I have my doubts as to whether the material could have held up. As I said above - translating the character of Superman through the screen is a hard enough task, simply because it's much harder to make his exploits engaging and have the audience relate to them. All considered, Singer did much better on this than most directors probably could have. He actually has created a few scenes here wherein a new side of Superman is revealed - and that is when the film is at its best.",13,13,MovieAddict2016,"Jun 26, 2006",

10,Superman Returns...and I'm glad he is here for good,"I came into SR thinking it would be the 3rd best comic-book movie ever, right behind X2. And it didn't disappoint.Now, I'll begin with the cons first, cause I like being negative. The biggest con is the plot of the film. Lexs plan is not really that good and its been kind of done before. Another problem was that it dragged at the end a bit after Superman 'defeats' Lex, though luckily the last shot was great that it made up for it a bit. It also dragged in the beginning. It showed too much of Lex in the beginning in which I think it should of just stayed focused on Superman/Clark. My last con would be Parker Posey, who I KNEW would be bad. Her character was too predictable and her acting was just bad.Now, the pros. Acting, aside from Posey, was great. Routh wasn't as good as Reeves, but as close as you can get. Bosworth actually was good, though there some times where you just thought, ""isnt she like 24 in real life?"" Spacey was the best Lex yet. But the two that really made the acting great was Mardsen and Sam Hunnington. Hunnington brought GREAT comic-relief. This film has a good amount of comedy in it, and its mostly thanks to Sam. Mardsen does great acting because he makes the love triangle not seem so ordinary. Usually, you have an asshole be the love interest, or a guy with some issues. Mardsen beautifully plays this stand-up, nice guy who cares about Lois and will do anything for her. You actually kind of root for Lois to be with him. The pacing was good, could have been better, but not a problem. Action was great, especially due to the music. The action+music worked so well together.Overall: A great, fun film with some minor flaws. Def. check it out, and if you can, check it in IMAX 3-D.8.25 / 10 The extra .25 comes from the fact that it was a summer blockbuster that didn't disappoint, and I have to give it credit as this has been a summer full of disappointments.",0,1,Tapion101,"Jun 26, 2006",

9,Routh and Bosworth becoming Clark Kent and Lois Lane,"This was quite a movie. I was a little worried about the new Superman actor, Brandon Routh. I was hesitant about going to the movie at first just because I am a big fan of the Superman movies with Christopher Reeves as Superman, and Brandon Routh in the previews and movie stills just did not look the part. However I am pleased to tell you that he did a great job filling in Reeves' shoes. It was almost like watching Reeves' all over again, just with enhanced cinematic technology. Routh and Bosworth really did their research into finding out how to act like Reeves and Kidder (Lois Lane). To all you viewers that have not seen it, enjoy! Because once you hear that Superman theme music in the beginning you will be pumped. It is quite a shocker.",0,3,havnerd,"Jun 26, 2006",
9,Fun at the movies: The Superman Experience!,"Often times I'll hear about a movie coming out, and I'll get very excited about it. I'll count down the days until it comes, I'll get tickets in advance, I'll buy into all the hype, I'll talk about it for days, and I'll get very tense and nervous as the theater lights dim and the movie begins. Unfortunately for these movies, I often walk out of the theater feeling let down and disappointed and wonder if maybe I should have just been born with out expectations.Having said that, Superman Returns is not by any means one of those movies. I'd waited months for this movie and got more pumped up about it than I'd been about movies in years, and while it may not have been the single best movie of its kind I've ever seen, it was the most fun I'd had at the movies since...oh I don't know...The Lion King. By far. This movie is everything I'd hoped it would be and more. I loved it. And it really wasn't just the movie itself. While absolutely first rate, it's not quite up to the standard Batman Begins and Sin City have set for me as far as the comic book movie genre goes, but a lot of what made Superman Returns so wonderful was the experience.I saw the movie in IMAX 3-D, and if you're going to see the movie, that's the way to go. The IMAX experience really immersed us into the movie and made it that much more fantastic and powerful. The 3-D scenes were terrific, and the crowd was wonderful. They actually clapped and cheered during the movie, they laughed and responded enthusiastically at all the right moments, and many people stood up just to cheer as the end credits rolled. Superman Returns is a strong reminder of why we love going to the movies and how fun and exciting the cinema can be.For anyone reading this that hasn't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend going now while the vibe is still strong, but either way this is not a summer movie to be missed. It is everything you love about Superman and everything you've been waiting for to hit the big screen. Enjoy!",4,5,andyp1986,"Jun 26, 2006",
7,Good solid Superman film,"I enjoyed the film a lot and think kids eight and older will enjoy it immensely. Far and away it is the best Superman movie so far of the entire franchise, being just a bit better than the first one with Christopher Reeve, which I also saw on opening day. The movie plays a little with some aspects of the comic's continuity, which comic fans won't like. And the movie has some plot flaws. However, the feeling of being there and sharing in Superman's powers really works. And, unusual in superhero movies, the dramatic relationships and story told really do hang together and create suspense for me.I also like the way the movie shows how there is no easy answer to a lover's triangle when all three people are decent and good people. Some critics will blast it for predictability and simplicity, but I don't think this is the case. Others will say there was no satisfying resolution to the issues the movie raises for itself. While this may be more valid, how many lovers' triangle situations in real life end in a neat and satisfying resolution for all concerned? Yes, there were flaws, and you will hear all about the flaws. For example Superman was gone five years and Lois Lane did not have a child when he left, but now has one who appears to be about nine years old. Or how about that Superman left for five years, returned, and still appears to be in his early 20s.The film's strongest aspect was the great acting by Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Spacey brings so much intelligence and sanity to any role he takes that he lifts it up. For the movie's plot suspense to work at all well, you have to believe in the villain's motivation and that he would act as he does given the situation. All of the actors turned in solid performances as well. The story was not really about Lex Luthor. It turned out to be about Supes and Lois's relationship, a fact that I bet surprised even the writer and director once the shooting of the film began.In this Superman, not every plot element was wrapped with a pretty bow tie, but that alone really worked for me and gives me much to think about. I congratulate the director and writer for letting the story go where it seemed to want to, rather than forcing it into just the superhero-fights-supervillain routine. That's what the first one in the series did, despite the fact there was another story there needing exploration too, and why I think this film superior to it.",0,1,djquigley,"Jun 26, 2006",
4,Superman Falls Short,"Brandon Routh went beyond what was expected and portrayed Superman to the T. Kevin Spacey's ""Lex Luthor"" though was quite a let down. Lex Luther, in the comics, is a criminal mastermind, being one of the smartest men in the world. The guy became the president for god sake. I just don't see this new Luthor having that potential. What should had happened with this movie is Singer should had done is homework gone to Dc and asked what is the biggest superman story you got. A simple Death of Superman movie could had been great. Shoot you could had done a trilogy with the next two films being the return of superman. Instead we got great actors, with a crappy, long, boring storyline. Did i mention it was boring. Ohh not to mention, what horrible twist there were in the movie, not only did they completely destroy the whole Superman Story, but they were completely unrealistic. But the film wasn't all that bad, it did have its moments, by which i mean 1. Where superman makes his ""return"" appearance. The Special effects somewhat helped me forget about how boring it was. Superman did not hit one bad guy, what they should had done was have Superman knock out Singer, for doing such a bad job, and wasting all the actors time and mine.",5,6,bails1004,"Jun 26, 2006",
3,That empty feeling,"Have you ever sat through a movie where the performances were dead on, the music and mood seemed perfect, the special effects were astounding, and the extremely long running time seemed not so long, but then left the theater wondering why it left you feeling nothing and wanting so much more. Welcome to Superman Returns. I attended the 10 p.m. night before showing not with high hopes, but confidence that with a mastermind director at the helm that this would not let down. Well, it really did. First off, I will give kudos to Routh and Company for doing all they could to make this great. He really was Superman. Now, what went wrong? It all starts with action. Now I know that Bryan Singer has brought a great human side to his previous comic book attempts, and he did it with dignity and style. But every comic book fan knows they also drool at the thought of a great action scene so they can watch their favorite hero do his thing. Well, you see the main two action scenes in the previews, one being the plane, and the other, the ship. Both disappoint. They feel short and boring and without tension as to what will happen, they end. We never get to see the man of steel fight anyone, all he does through this movie is pick up heavy things and move them. After this has happened so many times, it just gets redundant. The questions remain unanswered, as if the movie had no point but to make another movie. The loose ends are not tied up, only more are created. I don't want to give anything away because so many people want to see this film, and I don't want (not that it will) my opinion to distract them from seeing it, but the film, for me as well as the people I went with, just felt empty. Not much made sense, the action was boring, Luthor and Superman were face to face for about all of 5 minutes, and the movie is two and a half hours long. I don't want to go into more than this but I will say in summation that I just felt like nothing happened, nothing was resolved, and I just left that theater feeling empty and bored. I'm hoping to see it again just to make sure that maybe I was too tired or it was hot in the theater and it affected my judgement, but I doubt that was the problem. I think most of you will be leaving the theater the same way.",8,8,sackjigler,"Jun 26, 2006",

If you're looking for a no brainer with lots of cool cgi and action then rent King Kong. Superman returns is the 3rd installment that Donner should have made and Singer has done a phenomenal job. I'm going to see it again tomorrow in hopes of absorbing more of the greatness. All I can say for those who thought the movie dragged on..... well too bad this is Superman and all that he is. He's in love with Lois Lane, he overcompensates by trying to take on the world and yeah he has a bit of a hero complex. This was awesome, awe inspiring and a great time Singer has taken a legend in comic fandom and brought it to life in a way that makes me feel like tonight I was a part of something huge.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has a whole lot of competition for the #1 spot at the box office. I can't even really tell you how amazing it was, and you'll just have to go and see the movie to know what I mean when I say amazing.

I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know if it'd be more along the lines of Batman Begins or on the cheesy side like Spidey. It was 2 and a half hours long, yes. But I felt like the movie moved along more like a book at times--maybe more dry than some people expected. Some people were obviously underwhelmed because of that, but I had the exact opposite reaction. I just loved it. This could be completely dorky and a bit stupid or sentimental, but it seemed like the movie didn't just want to be hi-I'm-superman-fix-problem-fly-away over and over and over. Granted, all superhero movies have to have that. But it also seemed like there were slower moments simply to allow you to just sit back, satisfied, and think ""Yeah. That's Superman."" There were times that I wished I could have had just a few extra typical heroics or soppy moments to give me goosebumps, but overall I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see what happens next.Superman Returns is a befitting title. It's not Superman Begins. It's Superman Returns. And that's how I felt when I left the theatre.

9,Quite simply the best Superman film to date.,"If you can't already tell by my display name I am a huge Superman fan. But don't go misunderstanding that thinking it works to this films advantage, if anything it works against it.It knew it would be an extremely difficult task for anyone to make a film about the boy in blue that lived up to my standards, but Bryan Singer did it. Brandon Routh was cast perfectly as the man of steel, his simple mannerisms and lifestyle embody that of the character and the presence he brings to screen is tremendous. His acting is beautifully done and remarkably reminiscent of Christopher Reeves own performance in the original Donner films.The movie itself was tremendous, each character cast and played (in my opinion) perfectly. I can't think of a better actor than that of Kevin Spacy for the role of Lex Luthor and Kate Bosworth did an amazing job as the rigid but vulnerable Lois Lane. I was originally very concerned about the story, but I guarantee you that the film was placed in the best of hands. Bryan Singer and his writers deliver an amazing film that (no matter how much you think you know) keeps you guessing and leaves you breathless and completely satisfied. Take a very hard to please fan's and film aficionado's word for it. This movie is a must see and a tremendous contribution to the Superman franchise.",2,3,Supermanostl,"Jun 26, 2006",
10,Its all about the Movies again!,"I have been a fan of movies all of my life. From the early horror that my father made me watch to so of the strangest things that to this day give me nightmares.I 've been a fan of good and bad, but I have to say this movie has done what most people forget. It has helped lots of people want to go back to the movies. To relive that feeling of youth, which brought you to the movies as a child to see things only you can imagine in your mind.Now, although its hard to live of to Christopher Reeve, this movie was not about who directed it, or about who criticized it, it was about a film that need to be made. I, like most of you, happen to love this movie, and yet there are things I hated about it. But at least it was on the big screen so that I was able to judge for myself.This movie made people in my showing stand up and cheer, while my cousin fell asleep half way through. To each his own.

They are on there way. With a successful Batman movie and now Superman. They are choosing cinemas finest directors. Directors who know style and grace at the same time.

9,Leave out the comparisons and cheer with the rest of the audience.,"Reviewers compared the leads across various Superman films, compared story lines, compared departures from the original Superman. I just compared the spontaneous cheers from the audience during this film to those during the Reeve movies and those that I felt as a child with the Reeves television version in the 50's. This movie had children, adults and seniors cheering, clapping and rooting for Superman as if he were real. We were quiet or laughing otherwise - totally absorbed. And there's no doubt about the special effects being some of the best that I've seen in any film to date. If you've ever spent an hour with your eyes racing from panel to panel or had your heart race with the idea of Superman or even just wished that humans and America could be as pure of heart as Superman then go, get your fix of goodness, and cheer with the rest of the audience.",2,2,GilMunk,"Jun 26, 2006",

I thought this movie was great (except Lois Lane, Kate whoever was a bad choice,they should have watched some Kidder game tape as it seemed Routh did for his Kent. thank god they kept the classic John Williams theme too! i was afraid they were using the classic theme in the trailers to play on the nostalgia card but i was pleased that it was used through out the film not to much and maybe a bit too little.

8,Met each and every expectation and then-some,"I gotta say, I went into this movie with the highest of expectations. And one plot point withstanding, it met them all. When I first heard most of the casting I was disappointed, I couldn't see Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, or Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Both of them blew me away. Brandon Routh made a fantastic Clark Kent, though his performance as Superman left me with a little to be desired. All in all however, I was most impressed by our young reporter wannabe Jimmy Olsen, Sam Huntington somehow managed to steal each and every scene he was in. The story concentrated a lot more on the tension between Clark/Supe and Lois Lane, rather than the hero/villain action involving everyone's favorite hero and Lex Luthor. But this seems to be a growing trend among the super-hero movies in general. And it was in no way a bad thing.One final point, the Spiderman3 trailer rolled, gotta say it's the first time I've seen it, and unless I've missed something big, I think it's the first time it's been shown. Gotta see that one too.",5,5,Eagles_Fan_1,"Jun 26, 2006",
5,Not only bad but disgraceful to the Original,"It's five years later. Superman leaves all the responsibility of Earth to make some vague excursion to Krypton. This poor explanation is used about 45 minutes into Superman Returns. This is just one of the many problems this film has.Where to start? It all starts with Brandon Routh. He wasn't all that bad. For that matter Kevin Spacey wasn't all that bad either. But Kate Bosworth and Routh have no chemistry. None. They act like high school kids instead of two adults who have met before. Parker Posey continues her terrible comic book acting performances (See Blade: Trinity) here as well.The kid, he's a special kind of bad. Jar-Jar Binks and Ewok bad. Much like the plot which is very similar plot to the first one. Lex Luthor wants to build his own continent using crystals from the fortress of solitude. This would be fine for a 90 to 100 minute movie. Unfortunately this takes 2 hours and 37 mind-numbing minutes to resolve.",5,6,jeromecusson,"Jun 26, 2006",

9,The Man of Steel Returns,"In my many years of writing I have never felt so compelled to compose as I do today. Just hours ago I witnessed what may become the best movie of the summer. I say this with full knowledge of the offerings the box office produced. I was left high and dry during Poseidon, completely in the dark during Davinci Code, and I only enjoyed The Break Up. X-3 was, without a doubt, a fine flick, but left too much to be desired. For the seven of you who haven't seen it (thrice) I won't reveal anything, but I will recommend to take some time to watch the movie. It is highly stylized and worth the $10. On to the main event which, as I said before, compelled me to write. Superman Returns entered our minds with the briefest of teasers almost a year ago. It came and went, with rumors of Nick Cage playing the Man of Steel, and even one vicious lie about a CG Christopher Reeves. I do not know offhand the name of the newcomer who wears the red and blue mantle, but he wears it well. If you were to watch the original Superman and then catch the new version, you would be amazed at how well the transition comes off. I won't go into any details because I honestly think the movie needs to be seen fresh. I hate reviews that taint the experience, and I will not fall into that level of disparity. What I will do is give enough teasers to entice even the most comic-book-hating individual. For the....oh, who am I kidding? No one on this list will be unfamiliar with the caped savior of Metropolis. Superman, aka Clark Kent (mild-mannered and a bit dorky), is the last son of Krypton, a planet doomed to destruction by...well that part doesn't even matter. Whether it was a cataclysmic supernova or a computer gone haywire or an intergalactic plague, Kal-El (come on people, Superman's Kryptonian name) was shipped off via Galactic-Express to Earth where chance had him raised by two farmers. He was the ultimate illegal immigrant, but unlike many he earned his keep. And then some. Superman is almost 70 years old, as the comics go, but he is the most revered out of the millions (yep, that many) heroes out there. His powers are seemingly limitless and he has a slew of baddies waiting to put him down. His rival of all time, and the best bad guy in comic book history (Sorry Gandalf) is Lex Luthor, played by Kevin Spacey. I was worried, nay, terrified at the prospect of the soft spoken Spacey taking on a role best done by voice talents and Gene Hackman. Without giving it away, my fears proved unworthy of being thought. The movie will be incorrectly labeled as a continuation of the old movies, or worse yet, a comic-book summer thrill ride. I am here to say that this movie is (apart from being documented fact and worthy of a best picture nod) an homage to the greatest superhero ever created (and by two Jews, no less. We really are behind everything). The level of respect in this movie is on par with the level of reverence given to George Washington. In a summary: SEE THIS MOVIE. If you haven't seen it, go now. I mean literally this second. If you have seen it, go again. You'll want to know this one by heart. I understand it has its faults, as all movies of this scope must, but I came away with a mind blown. PS - Don't ask the inevitable question: Who would win, Superman or Jack Bauer? It's a case of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. Time and space collapse, yada yada yada.PPS - Don't ask what would happen if it were Superman vs Chuck Norris because that's a ridiculous question. Everyone knows Chuck Norris IS Superman.",0,5,nmladam14,"Jun 26, 2006",
10,Personal Review,"The movie it's self was fantastic! And this from a girl thats read every Superman comic her dad ever owned. The actor, Brandon Routh, fits Supmerman AND Clark Kent to a T, the awkwardness that Clark is suppose to have is right on the money and it's easily forgotten. And since I didn't read IMDb daily, everything was a surprise to me, which made it all the more enjoyable. But do keep your eye out for the 2 guys Lex Luthor kicks out of the museum, they're the writers of this new edition to the Superman epics. Also the bartender in the beginning of the movie is the old Jimmy. Not a big Superman fan, never read the comics? Oh well now's the time to get caught up with everyone else who's fallen in love with the world's best hero, who saves us for a dog eat dog world (hehe, literally in this movie!). Kevin Spacey does an incredible job as well and brings humor to the part of Lux Luthor at times where'd he'd just plain scare the pants off of the 6 year old next to me. Maybe it helps that I saw it at the Galaxy theater next to highland mall, their's is equipped with digital projectors - making the movie in HD quality with the new Gemini cameras the movie was shot with. Over all a great summer movie that knocks the pants off X-Men 3, Bryan Singer you done good.",36,37,sarah-arnold,"Jun 26, 2006",
7,"Pretty Good, but not super","This installment of Superman starts out very shaky, skipping time periods and playing catch up with an audience that either knows the old series or doesn't really need to.Some might say that this was important to make the movie have weight and back story, but it's not like you need much besides Kryptonite, invincible body, and available alien technology that's able to be stolen.After this 15 minutes at the beginning, though, the movie starts moving very well. There's a one liner after a plane sequence that is pretty amazing.I really liked the atmosphere of the Daily Planet, and I thought Routh did a good job as Clark. What I don't understand is how the movie never felt like it gave either of his personalities distinct moments on screen.Ebert commented that he seemed to be monosyllabic, and this is probably because when he had a real line to deliver (one in the opening and one at the end) they were VERY poorly said.I had no problems with anyone in any particular role, and the effects were great. But the movie started shakily and ended a bit overlong as well.I don't know... I liked it, but I didn't love it.",0,1,HolyGabriel-1,"Jun 26, 2006",
6,Objective Analysis of Superman Returns...,,1,2,superfanny,"Jun 26, 2006",Spoiler
10,A true jaw dropping picture!,"I just got back from seeing this film, and WOW! This movie is certainly an excellent depiction of what we would want Superman to do. His abilities are shown off several times over, and each time he does them you're mouth just gets wider and wider with either that stupid grin that a five year old gets when he gets his new bike, or the large void in your mouth due to how far open it is. This is just the cinematography, however, the plot itself, whereas it is simple, includes some obvious no-brainers, but every one with a little twist that makes you at least second guess yourself until you are shown what you originally thought.There are also great uses of metaphors in this movie. Without giving anything away, there are quite a few points that show what the characters are thinking or what the movie is trying to display without it being thrown into your face.The acting in this movie is spot-on as well. Brandon Routh plays the perfect Clark Kent, with that awkward clumsiness that I personally thought only Christopher Reeves would ever be able to do as Kent. The surrounding cast also plays a great role, with Kevin Spacey playing a truly diabolical Lex Luthor, who is definitely darker than the Gene Hackman that played Luthor in the previous series. All in all this movie is worth every last penny and I checked at the door on my way out to make sure that I didn't owe anything more, because I felt like I cheated the movie by not paying more. Even if you don't like comic book movies, this is a MUST SEE!",26,28,machoo42,"Jun 26, 2006",

7,Entertaining Film,"When I went to see this movie I had read all of the bad reviews so I was fully prepared for whatever nonsense I might have to deal with. I agreed that Bosworth did not look right as Lois Lane but after watching the film for a while completely forgot that she didn't visually fit the role so I feel she gave a convincing enough performance. If you're new to this film, it starts off as a continuation of the first two films that were made in the late 70's, early 80's. Superman just gets back from visiting his home planet. You might read some reviews that complain about this movie not explaining why he was gone for five years but the film explains clearly (in a sentence or two) that when Superman gets to his home planet it was just a graveyard. So he did nothing. There's nothing to talk about. His 5 years of absence is probably because his home planet was light years away. In fact, I'll bet it was about 5 light years away. Anyhow, while he was gone his enemy Lex Luther avoided going to jail because Superman failed to come to court to testify. Lex Luther is now out and about devising an evil plan. So here's where the movie begins. On to my review.My quarrel with this film is it does not make you believe it. Personally, as a viewer, I can respect a film that makes me lose myself in it. Seeing as this is a Hollywood blockbuster (think King Kong) you will find yourself in the middle of a few things you might find ridiculous. While entertaining for their visual/action effects, these things keep reminding you that you're watching a movie. Anyways, the thing this film DOES do is make you feel it. Strangely, this film seems to build its grounds more on its romance than its action. Not what one might expect from this film. Every dramatic scene of Superman saving this or that seems to try to communicate with the viewer just how important Superman really is. If you're one for feelings this movie might push you emotionally but if not you'll likely find yourself sitting in a bunch of over-dramatic rescue scenes with a hand full of social drama and mushy romance thrown in. It even has a soap opera twist to boot. (p.s. special effects are great) In summary, yes, Routhe could have done a better Kent. Yes, this film moves a little slow (put my 4yo son to sleep). But overall I found the film to be entertaining and emotionally gripping. I think everyone will be able to enjoy Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luthor. Some will even walk out of the theater very happy they made the trip to see this film. I did.",0,2,peelscreen,"Jun 26, 2006",

10,Superman Returns...there are no words...,"When the credits for this movie first swooshed across the screen my father looked at me and said ""I got chills"" I nodded and said ""So did I"" the rest of the movie proceeded flawlessly . The world has a new Superman and his name is Routh. Hackman is a nice guy but Spacey plows him outta the water; I saw the insanity and evil that define Luthor in Spacey something I never saw in Hackman. Kate Boseworth did everything a good Lois should do and more she amazed me. The plot? NO spoilers but it couldn't have been better every angle of the mythos was covered with a stop this movie teaches you everything about Superman you ever need or want to know. There are references to the first two that make you laugh and new aspects added that make you squeal with joy. The TV spots stated that our greatest hero returns June 28 and this movie removes all doubt of whether or not he is worthy of that mantle. After so many years without him, without seeing the famous red cape in popular culture mainstream Superman Returns and everyone will remember why they or their brother tied a red towel around his neck and ran around the house saying ""WHOOSH!""",4,5,guardian7,"Jun 26, 2006",
8,"Outstanding special effects, good acting, but...","...trying far too hard at every point to be like the original 1970's film. The Superman mythos has moved on since then, becoming more sophisticated and subtle. The relaunch of the comic in the 1980's set the stage for Lois & Clark, Superman the Animated Series, and of course Smallville. In every one of these recent incarnations, Clark represents the real person and he is consequently portrayed as a likable, competent guy in his own right who gains Lois' friendship and admiration without super-powers. The Superman personna functions to allow Clark to help people with his powers while protecting his personal life (and thereby his loved ones). This all is relevant because the Clark in Superman Returns is the same impossibly meek character people will remember from Christopher Reeve's portrayal. Can anyone buy that the movie version of Clark is a successful reporter at a major newspaper? The movie left me wondering what is the point of Superman even being Clark? Brandon Routh to his credit makes Superman look amazingly sexy and cool, but Clark should be the one Lois takes home at the end of the day (not a spoiler, just a figure of speech). Fans of the TV shows may find it hard to relate to the film Superman.Anyway, the leads are very solid actors but their youth (since the characters should both be about 40) was very distracting for me. Re-using Brando's image and voice was lazy and slightly obscene. Copying dialogue word-for-word from the Donner film in serious moments was just appalling, although it would have worked for a few lighter moments. The central plot had wonderful potential but was harmed by some loose ends and a few 'Hollywood blockbuster roller-coaster ride' moments which belie the otherwise somber tone of the film. I'm glad I went to see this opening night just for the spectacle of Superman in action. Do not go, however, expecting a seamless movie on par with X2 and Batman Begins.",24,22,saraswati77,"Jun 26, 2006",
2,For the average moviegoer...,"I'm not going to ruin the movie for anyone with gratuitous spoilers, so don't be alarmed... this is just an opinion.I like superhero movies (no more than the average person though). I've seen most of the recent ones (my favorite, thus far, being Batman Begins). Superman Returns is a film of epic proportions that isn't very epic at all. To put it lightly; it drags... endlessly.I can't account for comic book fans (especially the big Superman fans), but I think I can safely say many of the average moviegoers will find Superman Returns to be bland, insufferable, and pointless. The direction by Singer is nice, while the story and script are by-the-numbers. The film takes not a single chance and doesn't seem to believe that its audience might be in the mood for something fresh and different. It does what every superhero movie has done previously...but without much style. It's sad when a movie like this, a movie that cost so much to make (energy and money), becomes such a waste... a perfectly tedious misstep.",32,48,gotfilm123,"Jun 26, 2006",
6,Hmmmmm....,"This movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but it also wasn't as good as I thought it would be. (If that makes any sense at all). My primary concern was the same as everyone else's: will Brandon Routh be able to fill Christopher Reeves' boots? As it turns out he fits them a lot better than I expected. I was very skeptical as to whether or not Routh was going to be able to pull off the double roles of Superman & Clark Kent. But he does so very well. Routh seems to bear a stunning resemblance to the Kent that Reeve created. He seems to maintain his nervous canter and stature. However, his portrayal of Superman seemed to be that of his own. Routh introduced a darker side of the Man of Steel and I don't know if that was necessarily a good thing.The film itself was pretty slow paced, and the editing could have been done a lot better. I was glad on the other hand that the movie didn't do a complete recap of Superman's origins as I had anticipated. The plot line, I will not get too far into because I don't want to supply any spoilers, but I must say that it was the most disappointing part of the movie. The cinematography and the special effects used in the film were definitely up to par. While seeing 'Big Blue' in a realistic flight pattern was invigorating, the action and special effect scenes seemed to be so far and few between that it almost made most of the scenes anti-climactic.All-in-all, I felt that the film itself lacked the intensity that it needed. It lacked the fierceness that a new and re-vamped Superman movie should have. It seemed like a lot of drama and botched attempts at character development, and only a little bit of action. With a budget as big as this movie had I asked myself: where did it all go? I went into the theater with my mind ready to compare Superman Returns with Batman Begins, and it's no wonder that the 'Caped Crusader' is still my favorite Superhero.",0,1,TheConradMartin,"Jun 26, 2006",
10,Amazing,"Made up for the first 4. Even though it didn't follow the comments, Routh did a great job of living up to Reeve's standards. Everything about the movie was in sync with the first too, everything down to the credits. For Supe fans and non-supe fans alike, this movie is worth seeing. Kevin Spacey is one of the most believable Lex Luthors next to the one played on Smallville. Routh plays Clark and Kal-El with perfection. I'm not going to give away any spoilers here. Brian Singer did a great job of answering the question of weather the DC world needs a Superman or not. It brings back Jar-El from the old classics and it has a great effect on the film itself. As far as comic book movies go this did it. It got all the mythology and the stigma of big blue into a two and a half hour package. 10 out of 10.",1,2,motyka-1,"Jun 26, 2006",
9,Superman Returns: my review (spoiler free!).,"About the worst I can say about this film is that I wasn't completely, utterly blown away by it. It didn't totally skyrocket above my expectations. That said, it is definitely a worthy followup to Richard Donner's original, and a very good film in its own right.The new cast did a good job of filling the shoes of their predecessors. I'll take a moment to discuss the most scrutinized casting choice: Brandon Routh, a few awkward moments aside, assumes the role much as Christopher Reeve did. Rather than attempt to be larger than life and behave like an icon, he prefers to play it with more humanity and personality. He never comes across as a ""comic book"" character. Reeve has owned the role for 28 years at this point; no other actor has been able to earn it up to this point. But Routh put in his dues and he deserves it. He is Superman now. Consider the torch passed.Kate Bosworth plays Lois Lane much as you'd expect. She's tough as nails, a career woman, and is more than just a damsel in distress, but motherhood does add an interesting new dynamic to the character. James Mardsen is good as her live-in boyfriend/fiancée/whatever, and doesn't ever cover his eyes up. Oddly enough, the only original cast members I really found myself missing were Jackie Cooper (Perry White) and Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen). Their roles are the only ones I felt weren't recast well. The new Perry White was flat and uninteresting, and the new Jimmy Olsen is the Jar Jar Binks of this film. Hopefully they iron out the wrinkles in their performances by the time the inevitable sequel comes around.I was a little apprehensive when I read that Bryan Singer was going to be very faithful to Richard Donner's original vision, since it would be very easy for the project to descend into rehash. But rather than use Donner's film as a template to plug his own actors and lines into, Singer instead fashions his own film with a unique tone, albeit with frequent nods to the original. It's hardly a copy of the 1978 film, but it never misses an opportunity to throw in a few classic chestnuts for the fans. Also, look for Jack Larson and Noell Neil (Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane from the '50s television series, respectively) in small roles. To further tie this film in with the original, John Williams' original music cues are arranged into the score for great effect, and the opening credits are a modernized version of the classic sequence.The special effects in this film are incredible. There are some action scenes where Routh's performance is mixed with a CGI Superman, but the animation is impeccable enough that it's occasionally genuinely difficult to distinguish between the two. And this isn't Spider-Man. The artists didn't have the luxury of a hero who wears a full body suit and a full-face mask. They had to convincingly recreate Routh's face, hair, and expressions, and they do an admirable job. This is the absolute peak of Hollywood's current computer imagery capabilities.I won't say much about the plot. Luthor's scheme echoes the original Superman film: destroy old land (and the people on it), build new land over it. But that's where the similarities end. This time around, the real estate aspects of the evil plan are almost inconsequential. The focus is placed squarely on Luthor's revenge against Superman, and Kevin Spacey plays the part very well. He plays it a little less silly and a lot more dark and vicious than Gene Hackman did, but there are still a few moments of humor when the villains are around. The casting choice of Parker Posey as Luthor's female sidekick has gotten some attention, but it's not a big deal. Her character is basically a stand-in for the role Valerie Perrine originally played.Much of the plot is Superman and Lois coming to terms with lost love, but it isn't as nauseating as certain journalists seem to be playing it off as. Early reports of the film being a ""chick flick"" are exaggerated to the point of idiocy. (Of course, Singer deserves some of the blame for this, since he originally made the ""chick flick"" remark in jest during an interview.) And, as anybody who has read the press summary of the film knows, Lois Lane has a child, whose parentage may be more than it seems.All in all, I'm not sure I'd say it beats Donner's film. But it certainly beats any other screen version of Superman to date. I can't wait to see it in IMAX with the 3D scenes.",91,105,goodm0urning,"Jun 26, 2006",
10,I'm watching it again and again and again and again...its that good(***Spoiler Free****),"(*****Spoiler Free*****) June 27 2006There are always people that wont like a movie and there are others that like/love. I had strong and high hopes that this is it this is the summer blockbuster hit movie this 2006. I came to the 10pm early screening and brought some people that don't like superman but force them to watch it and told them that this movie is it the best super hero movie of all and also the greatest of them all. As soon as the movie started it was all good no great bringing back the original score for the intro, Marlon Brando, the planet krypton's looks, a little here and there respect for the 2 original movies before it, the opening scene style with letters popping out was amazing goose bumps every where man. Brandon Routh as superman/Clark Kent was good not the best like Chris Reeve's and not even come close to being Clark Kent but gaved respect because it came close so respects to him he is the new superman of this century.Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was WRONG!!! jks great he did well compare to the others but i personally prefer Gene Hackman's performance as Lex but its all good the movie was great man. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is okay i think she is the weakest out of the 3 she isn't the strong girl from the 2 older movies, more like a tune down version of the character but she is HOT finally a HOT girl as the hero's love interest(Comparing to Superman 1&2 and Spiderman movies).Bryan Singer got my respect as a Director the new age Director the new Steven Spielberg of this time and in his prime, respect him fully for bringing back Superman from the ashes. (please bring back X Men back also) Great writers because if it wasn't for the strong storyline of this movie then it will have a missing part. (look for the duo's cameo) The music score is good but sound more like x men 1&2 for me with a superman john Williams remix but good.This movie beats all the other superhero movie no doubt except Batman begins. Overall this movie delivers us the goods because i got some people that don't like the movie and don't even think the movie was good now they watched it they like it. Has everything to it humour, thrills, plots twist, action, love and great special effects and great MOVIE.

6,"Fun, but not great!","I am sure some die-hard superman fans will strongly disagree, but this movie had some flaws. Lack of character development, big holes in the plot and a let down ending keep this movie from being great. Enjoyable, but not great. Here we see superman returning from his missing 5 year hiatus. Lots has changed while he was off in space, searching for any signs of his home planet. His father is gone, Lex Luther is out of prison and Louis Lane is married and has a child. But things could be worse, for Clark Kent manages to get his old job back. Course, it doesn't take long for ole Lex to come up with a new scheme to take over the world... an 'insane' scheme... that would kill billions... and you guessed it, he has kryptonite. But really, the scheme is sort of dumb and makes no sense. And (no spoiler here) when Superman foils the plan, he does it in such an anti-climactic way that it leaves you wanting more but-kicking action. But I guess we will have to wait for ""Superman Returns... Again"" in a few years... All of this being said, there were some really good parts. With some really interesting surprises (though sorry to brag, i must admit, i guessed the surprise from the beginning)... But it is a good surprise that I wouldn't dare ruin by revealing it in this review. And most of the special affects were great. As seen in the trailers, when Superman rescues a crashing jetliner... when seen on the big screen, its is pretty awesome. Lastly, i say that I couldn't help thinking throughout the movie... ""how come they can not recognize him just cause he has glasses on?"" And, at times the movie even made fun of this a bit... I guess, as silly as the premise is, the movie had to stick with some of the basic rules. Overall, comic-book fans will love the movie. There were people (adults) in the theater literally jumping out of their seats with excitement during some scenes, clapping and shouting during others and when the movie was over, many remained seated until the theater emptied.

8,"awesome movie, good jokes, needs more action but still great.","great movie i thought, though could have had more action. after we see superman gets shoot in the eye, we want to see more, but we don't see as much as we expect action wise. other then that, many funny jokes, actually made me and my friend laugh, unlike in the movie spider-man. it is definitely worth watching, and if you see it in the theater, make sure you seat close to the screen, it really makes a difference with this movie. the acting was great too. this was probably the best superman performance I have seen so far. And finally, the best part of this movie is how it shows us how very very powerful superman really is, and that he would definitely beat the monkeys out of any hulk, batman, definitely Spiderman. You see him use some powers that I didn't even know he had! My friend kept asking me ""did they add this or was it in the original comics?"", because no one really knew how much power superman has, and what he can do with it. Basically, he can do anything he wants.",0,5,mikrosha,"Jun 27, 2006",
4,Why not just rerelease the first movie?,"From the very start since hearing about this movie I've been sceptical about it. I went to the theater keeping an open mind since other movies i was sceptical about recently turned out to actually be good (V for Vendetta for example.) While watching the movie I realised that this movie was never made for people like me. It was made for children and the people who liked the first 2 Superman movies. I was a child when I saw those 2 movies and loved them dearly, in my mind whenever i see Superman on film I'll probably see Christopher Reeve all my life. And this is why they probably chose Brandon Routh, he really does resemble Reeve a lot. But upon seeing the last 2 Superman movies recently.. I thought they were extremely corny and childish; and this movie.. is corny and childish.From the very start I couldn't understand why they were continuing from the first two movies instead of starting from scratch ignoring the last two movies which were unarguably terrible. (like they'd done for Batman Begins) If it was done to honor Reeve's memory then I feel it wasn't necessary. It's not like his Superman movies are going anywhere. They wouldn't have destroyed those movies if they had done something completely different.There are a lot of problems i felt with this movie. I felt it focused to much on the triangle between Lois and Clark and Richard. I felt the ""plot"" of this movie wasn't interesting and Luthor was a pretty lame villain, which made me sad. One of the only reasons i wanted to see this movie was to see Kevin Spacey play Lex Luthor and i was sad to walk away disappointed when i saw him play Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor instead.A lot of people will love this movie and I will most likely be one amongst a very small minority who didn't like this movie, but this is the way i see it: we have a Superman who's playing at being Christopher Reeve, we have a Lex Luthor playing at being Gene Hackman and we have a movie that's pretty much the same as the movie we saw 20 years ago... and i'll probably the only one to find something wrong with that.",17,18,doodieboy84,"Jun 27, 2006",

10,SuperMovie,"Bryan Singer outdid himself. I was disappointed when he left X-Men but now that he is part of Superman... wow. Beautiful movie. The story keeps you gripped and the twists are perfect. They don't come a moment too soon. Kevin Spacey is Lex Luthor, Brandon Routh looks just like Christopher Reeves and Lois Lane is played well by Kate Bosworth. The story goes well and little holes exist so everything that happens in the movie is shown and not assumed at all. I have to admit after seeing movies with Spider-Man and Batman and there counter-parts in Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne that I got used to a witty, funny superhero. Superman and Clark Kent may be the strong silent type but I don't find that the least bit discontenting. It's actually a break form the typical super-hero so to speak. Brandon Routh will do well with the franchise, fingers crossed of course... and so will Bryan Singer. Overall this is one of the best superhero movies I have seen.

7,Superman Returns in a big way,"Superman Returns is the long awaited return of Superman to the big screen, and I have to admit, it could have been much worse! I was fearing going into this movie that it would fall miserably short in comparison to Batman Begins, a wonderful movie that I couldn't help but try and compare to Superman Returns. But I realized something after viewing SP... this movie should in no way be compared to BB because they are two totally different movies. Now back to the review.First i'll start with the cast. I was a bit worried about how Brandon Routh would do in his first staring role in a movie, and I have to admit that he did an amazing job in my book. His chemistry with Kate Bosworth was great and I felt totally pulled in when they are on screen with each other. You can almost feel Clark Kent's pain when he looks at Lois Lane, and since this is a key part of the movie, it enhances the overall experience a ton. Kate Bosworth also shines as a beautiful new version of Lois Lane. I enjoyed her as Lois Lane, but fans of the original movies will some problems with her because she doesn't really bring the wittiness that the original Lois brought. Now before I start getting tomatoes thrown at me for this one, I gotta tell it how I saw it. Now i'll be the first to say that Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of our time, but I have to admit that I was left a bit disappointed. He looks the part of Lex Luthor very well and I don't think anyone else could have done the job as well as he could. Don't get me wrong, he did an amazing job, but during the first few scenes of the movie I didn't feel much from his performance. It wasn't until later in the movie that he really started to shine (especially in the scene on the boat with Lois Lane and her son).The movie was a bit on the boring side in the beginning, but as the plot began to start unfolding, it starts to pull you in and your along for the ride all the way to the end. Now as a young man raised on popcorn action movies, I did expect more action of Superman beating down villains, but there was hardly any to be found. This is really my only major gripe about the movie. I personally don't remember Superman punching a villain the entire time! Lois Lane's son seemed to do more damage than Superman, which is really kinda sad.All in all I have to say I enjoyed the movie, but if I was the director, I would have added at least a couple punches here for Superman to dish out so he didn't look like such a pussy. Now go out and see this great summer movie thats sure to make a killing at the box office.",2,3,KearseEagles90,"Jun 27, 2006",

5,Mildly Entertaining,"I didn't go into this film with many expectations, having seen comic-book movies at both extremes of the quality scale.""Superman Returns"" has pacing issues. The first twenty minutes will probably mostly bewilder you if you have not seen at least one of the previous movies (1 or 2). Much of the dialogue is dull, and formulaic subplots drag the film down.Here is the setup, in a nutshell: Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has hatched a ludicrous get-rich-quick scheme (Isn't he a billionaire already?) that will just happen to kill billions of people, and it's up to Superman (Brandon Routh) to stop him. Note that the main character is Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), not Superman. In fact, mild-mannered Clark Kent doesn't get much screen time at all.Action sequences are vital to any superhero flick, and ""Superman Returns"" has several. Early sequences will not disappoint, but later ones are less than spectacular. The movie has excellent special and visual effects, but sometimes it is unclear just what is happening due to short, jerky clips.There is no strong theme to this film. The fun action parts and a good dose of original comedic elements allowed me to endure the parts I found dreary. If I could replay my day knowing what I know now, I'd avoid ""Superman Returns"" in the theater and rent it after it's released on DVD.",22,20,UncleBatman,"Jun 27, 2006",

I wasn't a big fan of some of the decisions when I saw them on paper, but I have to say I was pleased with the performances.This movie had everything.

The sets look like sets during the ""big"" scenes. Yes, so what, a man can fly in a movie. Its not worth 20 minutes let alone 2 hours and 20 minutes. I feel disappointed and cheated.

,Superman is back with a vengeance,"Brilliant! Bryan Singer has directed a masterpiece. The 80's movies were great but face it cheesy lines and some bad acting (seriously Margot Kidder as Lois Lane). This movie has it all: romance, drama, comedy and tons of action. It's the Superman movie you've been waiting your whole life for. Kate Bosworth is amazing as Lois Lane. She fits the mold of the strong woman, but vulnerable when it comes to Superman. Brandon Routh IS SUPERMAN. He's Christopher Reeve incarnate. The writing is amazing and the directing by Bryan Singer is flawless. I've seen quite a few movies this year. This may be the best movie I've seen all year. It really is that good. It's like seeing Star Wars for the first time. I left the theater amazed at this REAL MOVIE! This isn't a typical comic book movie. This is a love story or is it an action movie? I guess it's all of them and frankly I'm glad it took so long to make it this good.",5,6,wiseguy400,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,And the world cheers as Superman returns,"When the idea of Warner Bros. reviving the ""Superman"" franchise surfaced a few years back, I had my reservations and doubted whether they can pull it off this time after a couple of ""Superman"" bombs in the '80s. Not even the departure of erstwhile director Brett Ratner and the arrival of Bryan Singer completely cleared it. Yes, Singer did a great job with ""X-Men,"" making not just a great comic-book adaptation but also a movie with intelligence and depth. Still, several questions remain. Could a relatively unknown actor carry the burden of portraying perhaps the most famous superhero of all time? Isn't this sequel made too late, more so after a pair of stinkers left the franchise on a bad note? Besides, I never fully liked the idea of Superman, a superhero almost without any weakness except for a radioactive element that's out of this world. I mean, where's the fun in that? So props, then, to ""Superman Returns,"" particularly to director Bryan Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris for bestowing upon us a more believable demigod of a character, albeit with an unbelievably thin disguise for his secret identity. (But what the heck, this is based from a comic book!) Completely ditching the idea that there were technically four Superman films made, ""Superman Returns"" starts where ""Superman II"" left off. Superman (Brandon Routh) comes back to Earth five years after he just suddenly flew off to the remains of Krypton, his home planet, in search of survivors. Upon his return, he learns that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has moved on, and is the author of the Pulitzer-winning article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" She is now a mother to Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu) and is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden without the ruby quartz glasses), nephew of Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White (Frank Langella).Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) was released from prison since Superman wasn't around to testify against him. Virtually forgotten by the public, he again formulates his diabolical plan of controlling the world while the rest of the population is sent to a frenzy over the return of The Man of Steel.Well, the plot does seem the fairly common superhero fare that's a dime a dozen nowadays, but the film's more than that, actually. Singer manages to create a masterpiece that equals, if not surpasses, what Christopher Nolan did for ""Batman"" and Sam Raimi for ""Spider-Man"" in terms of quality and satisfaction. Granted, Clark Kent doesn't have the advantage of Peter Parker in terms of mask of anonymity, but Singer has achieved to make the superhero's alter-ego into a bumbling nerd believable even as we know he can turn any moment into the stuff most of us mortals can only dream of. Routh, a ringer for the late Christopher Reeve, may not have the commanding presence of the original Superman, but the internal conflict of the script works well because his character is one the audience can a lot more relate with.Bosworth gives a spot-on performance as Superman's love interest Lois Lane, and she and Routh have great chemistry. She has a real confused character to deal with in Lois Lane who is clearly hurt by the sudden disappearance of Superman, and wrote an award-winning article to cover-up for what she felt was lacking inside her, whether she realizes it or not. Bosworth exudes charm while conveying Lois' emotions convincingly, and it's nice to see her getting better as an actress since I first watched her on ""Blue Crush."" Lex Luthor is about as ludicrously one-dimensional as most comic book villains, but somehow Spacey does a spectacular job of making him entertaining and convincing. He perfectly incarnates the character despite it being rather elementary. It veers close to camp, yet in the end there is sincerity and charisma in his performance.The visual effects are superb but more importantly, Singer and the special effects team don't go amok with the CGI. There's not much choreographed fight sequence or boisterous road chase to showcase them. Instead, they are built gradually along with the film's progression to enhance the story, rather than overpower it. Composer John Ottman employs much of John Williams' score from the original ""Superman"" while cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel sets most of the film in a balmy mood. These, along with the minute mannerisms from the original Superman films (just look at the opening credits), give one the feeling that Singer has much respect for the material.My doubts have been finally quelled. With Singer pushing the right buttons and a script that shows earnestness, ""Superman Returns"" delivers cleverness as often as it does excitement. It is, I might as well say it, super.",19,18,Jay_Exiomo,"Jun 27, 2006",

I still prefer Batman Begins slightly, but I was always a huge Batman fan. In any case, a film that can make the unbelievable believable, and cause a large sold out theatre full of people to cheer and clap like they did deserves to be seen by everyone, so don't wait!

8,Fresh old-school superhero tale,"I thought that Richard Donner's 1978 film, which I recently watched for the second time, came from the right place, but was largely unsuccessful. You would think, then, that I wouldn't get much out of a Superman franchise reboot that is nothing more than a rejuiced version of the Donner films, seeing as how I enjoyed Christopher Nolan's pastiche of all the best Batman elements.It is perhaps true that Bryan Singer's choice of adaptation can be limiting in that he wasn't able or willing to drop anything that perhaps didn't work ideally. Despite this, the film is an incredible, almost miraculous success. I'm really impressed with how well Singer does at creating good riff on something I didn't find that impressive, as I am with his general ability to sustain an un-ironic ""earnest"" tone without being overly corny (give or take a few minutes) or excessively anachronistic. The best example is Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor; he took Gene Hackman's Luthor, which I was none too proud of, and made it work (with help from the script I presume). Certainly, there are problems; some scenes go on forever despite their lack of suspense (the filmmakers only get a pass on the ""will Superman save them"" thing for the first time), and the ending is abrupt in all the wrong ways. Finally, I'm not sure if this will convert you to the pro-Superman camp, but it will satisfy both casual and true believers.",4,4,cwx,"Jun 27, 2006",

The visuals were on my mind, however they were lurking somewhere behind the thought of Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor or Brian Singer's talent for getting it done right and then this new kid Brandon Routh. Well to my surprise this film is captivating to watch, the landscape is a character with life all it's own. Spacey is outstanding, which some might think is standard, however he is truly diabolical as Lex Luthor with a maniacal twist of humor. Stepping squarely into the red boots and flowing cape Brandon Routh does so as if he were born to be Superman. Not just the strikingly nostalgic similarity between Christopher Reeve, but his fantastic portrayal of Clark and The Man of Steel, absolutely makes you take notice!

10,Superman Returns with a Roaring Applause,"Superman is the greatest hero of all time, his musical theme is one of a few pieces of music that (for me) can actually raise my heart rate and motivation level. I have eagerly been awaiting the release of a new Superman movie for as long as I can remember, and that goes back to when Nicholas Cage was signed onboard to play the Man of Steel. Superman Returns brings back the magic that was in the first two Superman movies. The tagline for Superman (1978) was ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"" In Superman Return you will again believe that a Man Can Fly. To me Christopher Reeves will be always be Superman. He was the Man of Steel and Gene Hackman was Lex Luthor. The casting could not have been better. Some will accuse Routh and Spacey of doing Reeves and Hackman imitations. I would have to disagree with this. In Superman Returns, Brandon Routh oozes Reeves. Routh embodies everything that made the Reeves performance so charming. Kevin Spacey transforms Hackman's Luthor into an even more diabolical maniac. Kate Bosworth was a much more enjoyable as Lois Lane than Margot Kidder's in the original. The movie expands on the Superman mythos and continues the story of Superman where Superman II left off (thank god, now all of us who really hate Superman III, and absolutely wish Superman IV: The Quest for Peace would go were all bad movies go can find solace that this movie happens before those disastrous incarnations). The connections to Superman and Superman II are cleverly done. There is even a homage to the Superman Lives movie (the one that Nicholas Cage was going to star in) that was never made but nearly $50 million was spent in preproduction. Without giving away the scenes of the movie, I must say the first scene in which Superman is really present was truly the best Superman rescue scene since Superman made his debut in the 1978 movie rescuing Lois Lane and the helicopter. In Returns, I and many other people in a packed theater jumped to our feet in applause when Superman saved the day. I felt like I was in that stadium cheering for America's greatest hero. Batman Begins revitalized the Batman franchise, Superman Returns will do the same for the Superman franchise.

I'm not a dyed in the wool Superman fan (or superhero fan). But, I wanted to see if the critics were right about the film or wrong ... so my son and I went to the sneak preview.The critics, gladly, are so wrong about this film it takes my breath away ... which is what the movie itself did for me (take my breath away). A lot had to be accomplished in it and a lot WAS accomplished. First, the film had to be expository enough to bring younger audiences into the fold ... those not familiar with the Reeve films. Secondly, it had to convince those who'd seen the Reeve films that Routh is a worthy successor. Some of my friends might hate me for saying this but, frankly, Routh's performance blew Christopher Reeve's portrayal of Superman right out of the water. Routh, in my mind, is clearly now THE DEFINITIVE Superman. Thirdly, the film had to stay true to its action core while giving new insights into the private lives of the main characters. And in doing so, a profound secret (one I won't repeat) is revealed ... giving any future sequel (guaranteed) something to build on.One note. I was especially glad to see Kevin Spacey get the role of Lex Luthor. He plays a brilliant if not demonic Lex ... and as a survivor at the end of the film is certain to return. My only disappointment, but not worth taking away from my score of 10, was the writers' treatment of Luthor's squeeze/moll, Kitty Kowalski. I hope more of her is fleshed out in future incarnations. But, I forgave the writers almost immediately because of their wise decision to NOT include a similar ""comic relief"" character (ala Ned Beatty) like in the Reeve films. Frankly, I as a film-goer didn't WANT to see comic relief for Lex Luthor ... and hope future incarnations remain as evil as in this film.Every minute of this film was a good minute ... deserving to stay as part of the whole. Kudos to the film editors for not tampering with things too much.

The Superman we see in this movie is one that clearly has a human heart and although he is the Man of Steel on the outside, it is his clear human upbringing that we sympathise with and feel his pain throughout the movie. The casting was pretty much spot on and although i had my worries for Lois Lane and some of the lesser characters such as Olsen they all get pass marks.

8,Two big thumbs up!!!,"Thoroughly impressed, good storyline, even for 2-1/2 hours it keeps your interest.....never bogs itself down in any way, good job of casting and keeping up with important details that all fans of Superman will recognize, truly impressed with the lack of commercialization meaning there weren't any blatant ""product placements"" of any kind that I can remember...all in all it was worth full price, worth 2-1/2 hours and well worth the wait...judging by the fact that 2 screens were showing it the night before it's official release date in our small town (and both screenings were full) this is going to be a big money-maker (thanks to Smallville for bringing in new fans) and I don't really see where anyone will be able to bash the film in any way and be justified in doing it. Brandon Routh takes a few minutes to warm up to but once he gets back into his Clark Kent persona at the Daily Planet,he plays the part admirably, Kate Bosworth is stunning and Kevin Spacey does his normal thing (quiet but convincing in the role of Luthor) by just playing his part and not trying to steal the spotlight from the rest of the cast.

8,Outstanding summer blockbuster worthy of the title.,"I didn't quite know what to expect of this one - another lame Hollywood sequel? - and was more or less blown away. Consistently extraordinary effects and visuals combined with sincerity and underplayed expression on the part of Brandon Routh as our new Supe - well done from start to finish (just ignore the obvious breaks in logic, sit back and enjoy the wild, wild ride).This is one of those shows that is not driven by the expensive and stylish effects, but enriched by them. The primary characters are thoroughly drawn, and the two plots (love story and evil genius with world-dominating plot) are balanced. I'll see it again, just for the fun of it.",2,3,johnme23,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Still grinning the next day...,"I went to a 10PM showing last night, (tuesday) to see Brian Singer's next big thing. First, I should point out that I am a comic book fan. I collected them feverishly as a child and will still pick up an issue on occasion. Basically, I have a very in depth knowledge of the character and I do have certain expectations. With that said, I should also note that I am *not* a huge fan of the Donner films. I just felt them to be a little too campy and contrived. OK, now to ""Returns"". As I stated in the title, I am still grinning the next morning. There have only been a few movies that have given me this feeling after watching them. The first Matrix, the first Batman, Both Spidermans, The Lord of the Rings, etc. The movie has its flaws, as I am sure you have heard reading other reviews, but the flaws are easily overlooked. For example, the timing in the beginning and the end of the movie is a little suspect, but the meat of the sandwich, as it were, is phenomenal. There are moments of the movie in which I felt that I ""truly believed"" in what I was seeing. Brandon Routh carries the Superman mantle to the next level, even beyond Christopher Reeve. Routh's Superman has an air of Nobility and dare I say Godliness that was not present in Reeve's performance. Where Reeve was over the top with his ""Boy Scoutiness"" (I made up that word), Routh seems to slip it on like an old pair of pants. It just fits. Routh is able to bring the pain of the relationship with Lois to the screen brilliantly. He allows Supes to be ""human"" without being fragile. Kevin Spacey was, of course, brilliant. I still rank him as the most under-appreciated actor in Hollywood. He has his Oscars, but somehow, that doesn't seem enough. He follows Gene Hackman's performance and flair without imitating him. I do need to point out here that I do not like the Silver Screen Lex Luthor. This is a character that has never been done right with an actor. My Lex Luthor is in the comics or even in the Superman Animated Series. With that said though, Spacey was scary and evil and believable. I just looked back and saw that this is starting to get a little longer than I wanted, so I will end this with two things. One -Sam Huntington finally got Jimmy Olsen right. This is the way this character should be. I am not going to explain it, just watch and you will see what I am talking about. Two -Superman has always, and will always be the quintessential (spelling) Hero. He is everything we strive to be and at moments are. He is our savior. He is our friend. For those of us that are true fans of this genre, Superman is on a different level than all other SuperHeroes. For the first time on film or TV, you will see this. Go enjoy this movie and pay no heed to the critics out there that need to be overly critical to sell papers and further their careers. Watch this movie for the pure selfish reason that after any long day in this ""real"" world, you need to escape sometimes to Metropolis where a man really can fly!Thank you for reading my ramblings...",5,6,hess1275,"Jun 27, 2006",
3,Hollywood at it's worst,"The three points out of ten that I'm giving this movie basically apply purely because it's Superman and it's hard to make a completely bad Superman movie. The action will always be exciting and the special effects were (with the exception of two notable scenes) dynamite. A solid mention goes to Kevin Spacey, who gave a creepy performance as Lex Luthor.That being said, the rest of the casting was just horrible. Routh's Superman was a very stale version of Christopher Reeve's Superman... he just didn't emit the still confidence that Reeve had, yet seemed to be emulating his every move. Kate Bosworth never once felt like Lois Lane and even in the last hour, I felt like I was watching a completely different character, and I'm not even going to touch on the poor performance. Other notable casting screwups were Kal Penn (most notable as Kumar of Harold and Kumar) as one of Luthor's henchmen. It should be noted that he had no lines nor any spots of comic relief, he just served as a very unbelievable henchman... which seemed to garner laughs every time he was on screen due to the sheer out-of-placedness of this actor. James Marsden (Cyclops of X-Men fame) felt out of place and awkward in this film. The movie might be the slowest superhero film ever with several wasted scenes. The movie obviously needed to be trimmed up by at least half an hour and I easily think of a half an hour of this film that could be excluded and greatly improve this movie.",22,27,bradn-1,"Jun 27, 2006",
7,Very long but interesting ...,"Superman has definitely returned in this epic 2 1/2 hour movie. However, with that said ... it could have been better.I won't go into the plot as not to spoil anything for anyone but I will say that the main drag points included the first half of the movie, where the dialog dragged on and there was only a tiny bit of action. Here is where I think most people will find themselves bored and wanting to hit the ""fast-forward"" button when it comes to the DVD.The second half of the movie was better paced. It may have been a boring film overall for some, but the second half contains the best segments of acting, action, and story. It was a welcome splash in the face that it was not all long and a bore.By the end, I was surprised as many people ""liked"" it as they did. I had one say it was ""crap,"" but people must really like their Superman to be willing to see his emotional side. That was something I definitely did not expect.If you are looking for an action-packed movie, see X3. If you are looking for a movie with heart, soul, some humor, and a good bit of action, this movie is for you.",0,1,kranon,"Jun 27, 2006",

I was excited for this movie to come out and had been anticipating it for months.The plot and screenplay were both very well done. I was trying to think of a way to make a movie with a plot that hasn't been used before for a man who only has one weakness. I was very impressed with the story and the comic book feel of the movie. It still stayed true to the original Superman movies and Kevin Spacey was an excellent Lex Luthor.I don't want to go into the plot or other details, but I was very impressed and I highly recommend it.",1,1,Korath52085,"Jun 27, 2006",
,a GIRLS perspective.....,"Last night I was able to catch the movie Superman Returns. I'd like to preface this review by saying that I have never seen any superman movies, know barely anything about superman, and avoided all press about this movie. I wanted to go in knowing nothing (typical female- the horror!) and see what happens. I wanted a legitimate GIRLS perspective on the flying man in tights, and I think I was successful.Well... I absolutely loved this film. It was entertaining; it kept me excited and enthralled the entire time. The first 10 minutes had me thoroughly confused, because I had no idea what was going on- that is the part where I think knowing something about the other superman movies would help. However, after the basic plot is laid out, the movie gets tighter and more exciting and in typical Bryan Singer fashion, is loud, raucous and fun.So what can I say about the plot that hasn't been said before? Well superman is back after 5 years of tending to some business. The plot does leave some holes and never really answers the question of why he was gone for so darn long. But no matter, the whole movie basically defies logic, so I'm willing to let that go. While he was gone, his love interest, Lois Lane, moved on. In fact she moved on so much that she has a fiancée and a kid! This sets up the most interesting part of the movie- a love triangle between Superman, Lois and her fiancée (a triangle that is a tad controversial I might add). Of course, Lex Luther is also out of prison and scheming up an evil plan that reminded me of something Dr. Evil would hatch.The visual effects were nothing to write home about- very good but nothing out of the ordinary, nothing that we haven't seen before. There were 1,400 fx shots and they had to be done quickly. Watching the credits, I realized that the studio had farmed out shots to many different companies, which perhaps led to my feeling that the effects weren't cohesive -you could almost tell that they were done by different studios. Probably the most exciting sequence both visually and edge-of-your-seat exciting ( I was literally holding my breath the entire time) was in the beginning of the movie, however it was so good it was hard to top it later on. Overall, however the effects kept the movie going, and added to the overall experience.My complaint about Superman is that he is too good- he really has no weaknesses, and cannot feel pain. He can stop anything, he is faster than the speed of light, he is strong, he can be everywhere and anywhere at once, and of course he can see through things. However, Brandon Routh, the new actor filling some big shoes, makes him very sincere and almost naive. You believe his romance with Lois Lane, and although it is very complicated, I liked the couple together. (An interjection: I am always critical of female leads in movies such as these- they are almost always annoying and whiny. Case in point, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane annoys me to no end. However, I really liked Kate Bosworth's performance, because she and Brandon Routh had excellent chemistry and she was fun to watch). I haven't read many reviews yet about the movie, but many are saying that it doesn't compare to the originals, Christopher Reeves was much better blah blah blah. My perspective on that is that it doesn't matter. This is a summer movie in which you are supposed to be entertained. It has great effects, a good story, wonderful music I might add, and it's just fun escapism. It's pointless to compare and if you do that, you will always find that the new movie is inferior, because that is the superman curse. The new supermans will never live up to the old ones because they just can't- the old ones were too good. You are setting yourself up to be disappointed if you go in with that mindset and attitude, and that would be a shame! Superman Returns does not reinvent anything, it's not groundbreaking, but it is enjoyable and a good time. There are scenes that perhaps could have been very cheesy and made you laugh, however instead they were very sweet and innocent. I highly recommend seeing this movie, although I recommend doing it MY way: going in with an open mind and see what happens. As for all you girls out there, who like me, don't know much about superman, definitely see this film. It's worth it, and you can still get a lot out of it, and will probably enjoy it more than others who have seen the older Superman movies.:::www.animationchick.com:::",0,1,animationchick,"Jun 27, 2006",

7,Tired of Superman?? Don't think so!!,"Many skeptics believed ""Superman Returns"" would potentially suffer due to a lack of quality and genuine originality, ripping off the other Superman-related TV Shows and movies. And although at times the movie did seem to have certain parallels to other superhero movies, the movie didn't get bruised in any way. It's almost like a crash; we see the sudden adrenaline rush in the most fascinating way. Superman is their hero and they are his family. Metropolis crumbles under the weight of hopelessness and vulnerability now that their savior has disappeared.""Superman Returns"" to planet Earth and once again reunites with Lois Lane to finally (?) put an end to Lex Luthor. This is a story of hope, survival and (as tacky as it seems) family and love.Five years after Superman disappears (and, coincidentally, so does Clark Kent), he falls directly into his earth-parents' farm after being absorbed into a meteor. He quickly recovers and goes back to work at the Daily Planet where he finds out Lois Lane had been married and now has a child. Elsewhere, Lex Luthor is now out of prison and married to an old billionaire who signs away her possessions with the last breath she has. Lex takes the money, and finds large crystals buried in Superman's Fortress of Solitude that can give him power beyond belief.""Superman Returns"" is a powerful ode about the most powerful and popular superhero ever. With edge of your seat action sequences, and some plot twists, the movie is as powerful as The Man of Steel himself. What makes this movie more interesting is how we see weakness and vulnerability in Superman. He suffers from the now-healed society which no longer includes Superman, and in one awe-inspiring scene, he is dragged across water and dirt by a human and we see just how humanistic this one man can be.Director Bryan Singer directed this movie almost flawlessly -- and it's no surprise, him being the director of the first two X-men movies. His display of special effects is uncanny, paying tribute to the Spider-man movies with both flying sequences and creating almost a whole city in CGI. Brandon Routh was a really good choice for Superman. His entire face seems almost metal and mannequin-like.There are a few plot holes in Superman though. It does not really start off where the first three ended off. Now Lois doesn't know Clark Kent is Superman, and it doesn't really explain how and where Superman came from, and where he'd been for five years. However there is an obvious motivation for Superman's drive, and a definite character development. Not to mention a footage of Marlon Brando himself.In all, ""Superman Returns"" is a fun, thrilling, nostalgic movie that keeps you wanting more and more. And while being compared to classics such as the Reeves franchise and even the Hatcher/Cain phenomena, the movie stands alone as the most powerful of them all.",0,1,highkite,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Absolutely gratifying,"To put it bluntly, I did not know what to expect going into Superman Returns. I had read mixed reviews of the performances and story-line, but was still willing to see a 10pm screening the day it came out.Boy, was I glad I did.Superman Returns is absolutely breathtaking. Not only was the story incredible, but Kevin Spacey brilliant as Lex Luther. Of course, my worries were about Superman himself, and Brandon Routh filled the role marvelously. I cannot imagine a better Superman than himself.Now, the casting worked out well, and so did the story. Though there were a few story lines that strayed from the comic series, the story really flows.As for the film visually, I am going to go out on a limb and say that the special effects were the most realistic of any film I have seen. The scale that this film was on was truly massive, and it was pulled off perfectly. Not only are the destructive scenes great, but the calming love story of Superman/Lane was pulled off very well.And you cannot ignore the homage to Superman I and II. This truly did seem like a continuation of that series.I loved it, and think it may actually have been better than Batman Begins.",0,1,steve9347,"Jun 27, 2006",

Contrary to that last comment, Superman Returns is my favorite movie because of the plot and the cinematography was amazing. The Spiderman movies are very good ""superhero"" movies but Superman Returns went far and beyond just a good ""superhero"" movie. I feel that they did and excellent job of casting Clark Kent aka. Superman. I highly encourage you to see this movie.

Kate Bosworth added charisma and sex appeal to Lois Lane, Margot Kidder was good but not exactly the most attractive woman. I was kinda hoping for some kind of connection or cameo from Bruce Wayne, (rumor mill) but that didn't happen. If Hollywood decides to make a Superman/Batman film it will no doubt be a blockbuster with the 2 new caped crusaders at the helm.

10,This is great stuff...,"Bryan Singer has made some of the best comic book movies of all time with the first two X-men. He raises the bar even higher with Superman Returns. The cast was very well chosen, even down to Kate Bosworth who I had my doubts over when I saw previews. Brandon Routh is a stoic, classic hero as Superman, but plays the bumbling Clark Kent with equal aplomb. The action sequences were breathtaking and some of the best CGI work I have ever seen on film. Singer managed to tell a great story about the burden carried by our mightiest hero and it he told with visuals. There was no long dialog to explain why what was happening was so important, it showed you in the expressions on the public's face and the look in Superman's eyes. Kevin Spacey was excellent as usual, walking the fine line between showing the sarcastic humor of Lex Luther and the deeply sadistic maniac underneath. Singer played this movie very straight, there was no tongue in cheek, it was played with great sincerity and obvious reverence for the 1978 movie. This film restores a mighty hero to his rightful place as the world biggest boyscout. The world needs Superman as an example of letting the best sides of our nature be in control. Left open at the end I can only hope many more Superman movies follow that have the gravity and power of this one.",1,1,dune457,"Jun 27, 2006",
6,good summer movie....,"I felt that Singer did a good job with the source material and in making it ""dark"" like Batman Begins, but it's Superman--you can't really make the material too dark without going against the very persona of Superman himself. Still, Kevin Spacey's performance alone makes Superman Returns *almost* worth the price of admission, but there's nothing really very new or innovative here. At least that's what I thought. But if you want a good summer movie, I'd definitely go see it. Otherwise, I'd wait for the DVD--the showing I went to last night reminded me of why I hate multiplex crowds, although it was a better theater-going experience than normal because everyone was excited to see Superman. I don't think that'll be the case with later showings though.",0,1,geoneb,"Jun 27, 2006",
1,Superman Sucks,"This film plays like a bad sequel to the original two Superman films. If this really had been the third film, if it really had been ""Superman III,"" this is the one we wouldn't be watching anymore. The two main characters, Superman/Clark and Lois Lane, have nothing interesting or fun to say to each other. The whole ""old boyfriend"" coming back into your life--and Lois' baby--is so ill-conceived that it's baffling the film was ever made. Lex Luthor is a joke and his big plan is a muddle. The film is relentlessly sour, clumsy, pointless, and then in the big action conclusion suddenly sadistic and unlikable. Superman does nothing but fly around catching things, bigger and bigger things; you know, he can do more than just lift up heavy objects, Singer! Wow, what a disappointment. The lack of originality in this film, the endless length, the absence of any real thrills or fun makes this one of the biggest missed opportunities in recent memory. In every way this is a complete failure, from the casting to the story to the decision to film with that ""great new camera."" If it weren't for the soundtrack constantly evoking for us the two earlier Donner films, there would be absolutely nothing in here that works. Should you see the film? Of course! Everyone should see the weirdest, saddest train wreck in a summer filled with bad movies.",32,35,Vinny-28,"Jun 27, 2006",
7,Overall a good return,"I went to see the movie last night at 10pm. I liked how the kept the original style of opening credits. Brought back good memories of being a kid watching the first Superman.The storyline was good though lengthy. Over all the story moved quickly but at points did drag. Being primarily a love story the action was subdued but suspenseful.I like the concept of this being more of a love story to bring a light into Supermans more personal side.As far as the acting.. Kevin Spacey has brought back the Lex Luther attitude and look beautifully. By far my favorite actor for the movie. He did not miss a beat with how Lex Luther is in the previous movies,Smallville, and the comics.Brandon Routh.. OK it is scary the resemblance to the young Chistopher Reeve. Overall a good job in a tough shoe to fill. He definitely did Clark Kent well with the bumbling guy act.Kate Bosworth.. needs a little more work getting the Louis Lane part down. She is a good actress but finding a Louis Lane replacement is hard after how well Margot Kidder did.",0,1,nomian,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,"dark, lyrical, and disturbing","This movie is not like any other Superman incarnation. It pays homage to the classics - there are notable winks and nods to the comics, TV series, and original movies - plus genuinely silly moments that remind us of the ridiculousness of the whole thing. However, most of the movie is slow, calculated, and depressed, which isn't to say it isn't satisfying to watch.It's understandable that Superman would come back in a funk after five years away, visiting his destroyed homeland and realizing he is, in fact, the last son of Krypton. It's fitting that his Clark persona has gotten rusty in the meantime, that he's neither as bumbling nor as charming as he was before he left.Superman has come back much more alien than before - he barely speaks, and is single-minded and self-sacrificing to a degree unprecedented in the mythology (as far as I know). He's practically given up on the love of Lois Lane, and he's separated himself emotionally from the human race even as he's dedicated himself to saving it (fans of Clark Kent, beware - Clark is totally absent in the last third of the film). And yet, because he is vulnerable and passionate in an understated way, we care for him more than ever. There are moments when he's back to his catch-phrase self, but most of the time, he stares in the face of seemingly impossible-to-overcome obstacles with joyless determination. And we admire him for it.Kevin Spacey is chilling as Lex Luthor. Kate Bosworth is passable as a less obnoxious and slightly more intelligent version of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane. The special effects in this film are as good as you could ask for, but they're not important. There are lyrical moments of breathtaking beauty, which, if you're not a visual person, can get slow, but if you recognize their significance, can really stick with you long after the film is over.However, this film really isn't about Lois, Lex, or the action. The point of this installation is to make you think about what it really means to be Superman, and how depressing that really is. And then appreciate that our hero is still willing to be our hero, because we do, in fact, need him, perhaps more than ever.",1,2,perlner,"Jun 27, 2006",

A big story starts to build up about the evil plot Lex Luther is doing ( you don't know what it is exactly.) and then you find out what he wants to do and it is really kind of stupid. Than after that the movie only focuses on the love story between Louis and superman. Than it goes really slow and get's boring. The effects were good and the beginning was good, So I would just wait to watch it on DVD because if you see it in theaters you will be disappointed.

I think Brandon did an amazing job, and he looks so much like Christopher Reeves. I have to assume by the way it ends that we can expect a Superman 5, which would be great. But for all of you who have heard bad reviews, I suggest you go and watch it yourself.

4,not very good,"I saw Superman in an advance screening at the movie theater I work at and this pretty much sums it up: the trailer for Spiderman 3 was more exciting than 2 hrs and 40 min of Superman Returns. I do not know much about Superman or the comics which is hard to watch this movie because it just picks up on a story that we don't get to watch. The movie takes place 5 years after Superman has put Lex Luther in jail. Superman left earth to find his home planet and when he returns Lex was released from jail early because Superman wasn't around to testify. He has married an old woman and when she died he got all her fortune and of course he has some evil plan as well. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but it involves Lex breaking into the Fortriss of Solitude--okay if this is Superman's home wouldn't it have some sort of alien protection that people couldn't just in it and access the crystals? When ""Clark Kent"" returns to the Daily Planet, Lois Lane has moved on and now has a kid and is with the father. One thing that bothered me was the complete lack of chemistry between Routh and Bosworth. All in all it just come down to it that this is just not a very good story. I wish they would've just started the story from the begginning and put a new spin on it. Save your money and see X-Men 3 if you want to get your superhero fix.",25,32,joe_7485,"Jun 27, 2006",
7,Superman Returns to get rid of that bitter taste that X Men 3 gave us.,"Superman Returns starts with an opening title sequence that is made to annoy anyone who isn't watching the movie in IMAX 3D. This is not a 3D movie, except in certain theaters when available. The problem is, it looks like a 3D movie everywhere.The other problem is, I thought one of the largest franchises in the world would be above bullet time. Or, at least, Faster then a speeding bullet time. Still, Routh performs a great Clark Kent, but plays Superman more or less as a pretty boy and not a triumphant hero, lacking the charm of Reeve's original performance. While Gene Hackmen may have played a great evil Genius and went over the top, Kevin Spacey took a psychotic character who was over the top and tried to bring him down a notch. And he literally stole the show.I really don't understand why the people at the Daily Planet are so stupid. Not only does Clark go on leave for five years and Superman Returns the same day, Superman spends a week in the hospital for part of the movie, and by default Clark doesn't show up for work, without calling in or anything.James Marsden probably will never be given enough credit for his performance as Richard White. His character was perhaps my favorite in the movie. He plays Lois Lane's long time fiancé (for five years) and the father of her kid. He is also very nervous of her past relationship with Superman. Now, we all know about the past relationships with Superman, and if the series continues, there will be more relationships with Superman. The writers could have taken the easy way out and made him a jerk, made him stupid, or all sorts of things.In the end, though he obviously lacks the powers, he's as Heroic as Superman in many ways. Lois shows nothing but love for him, and confusion when Superman arrives. She really doesn't want anything to change. Yet Marsden is very aware that she may slip away, but that does not stop him from trying to help her or Superman by the end.And now, the kid. Lois Lane has a kid who she doesn't seem to mind tagging along while they break into a houseboat. You know, that's pretty much child neglect if you ask me. Well, you can predict a lot of this story line, but the movie in general toys with it's predictability, and has a bit of fun with the audience.Keeping with the tone of the Donner/Lester films, this movie has some really dark moments, some massive destructions, but a really strong sense of humor. Unlike the earlier films, it never comes off as disjointed.Again, we have to find ways for human characters to create a challenge worthy of Superman. The Challenge presented does suffice, and while we know Superman is going to win in the end, we see that he is getting hurt pretty badly. Even as Zod had him ""kneeling before him"" I never once thought the character was in any danger. Hell, he's Superman. As the name implies, he can do just about anything.Like X2: X-Men United this is a long movie. However, it just doesn't feel that way because Singer paced the movie very well. Compare to other Superhero fare, like X-3 which felt as short as it was. Singer knows how to pace movies, and manage to balance several story arcs at once.All in all, it's a pretty good movie. It has it's good, it has it's bad, but I think the good outweighs the bad. If you liked X Men 3, this movie is not for you. It has the wit and intelligence that X Men 3 lacked. It had adventure, character development, and just the right touch of humor.***/****",1,1,Newski_the_Hippie,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Staying true to the red and blue while making the movie feel current,"I thought the movie was absolutely well done in terms of Singer's ability to capture the original essence of the previous Superman movies, but put together with all of those things we love about our movies today. That is the single best thing about this movie. It feels as if you can watch all 4 previous Superman movies and this one would fall right in line. Die hard fans will be appreciative of the plot and the way Superman stays true to his roots, and newer fans will enjoy the way Superman outshines any of the latest superhero movies.The plot was excellent and well thought out, and there is enough action in the movie for some of the guys like me to feel we got our money's worth. Kevin Spacey plays a wonderful Lex Luthor equipped with his criminal intelligence who would have made Gene Hackman proud. The supporting cast also does a great job keeping your eye off Superman. Hats off to James Marsden who plays an excellent job as Lois Lane's fiancé and possible backseat to Superman. Not much you can do when your lady used to date the man of steel, but his behavior of both concern and curiosity is captured well on film.My only quam with the movie is that as a fan you feel as if you live right there in metropolis and want to have your own one-on-one conversation with Superman about where he's been and what he's been up to. And although the reason's are covered in the movie, I personally would have like the to hear the director's cut version. Great flick!!",0,1,Hookdignious,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Superman soars,"OK OK, so it definitely has some problems, but that doesn't prevent me from loving it anyway. Singer accomplishes a difficult thing by making the often conceived as boringly perfect Superman relatable with a poetic film just dripping with yearning, pain, and sacrifice. Singer's prowess is undoubtedly his ability to make you feel for his characters (which he does so well in the first two X-men movies), and his choice in making Superman's feelings for Lois and the father/son theme at the core of the film is decidedly brilliant because these are all emotions we can relate to ourselves. Thus those who find Superman boring won't, because he is made extremely human by all of those things. Although the best moments in the film, in my opinion, are the dramatic ones, Superman Returns still provides a ton of good old-fashioned action. See it on IMAX if possible for those breathtaking four scenes in 3D! Kevin Spacey does a lovely non-campy but still entertaining version of Lex Luthor (though a problem here is that his storyline is not as interesting as Superman's story--the film feels less like a film about a hero vs. a villain as much as a drama with action pieces), and Routh is wonderfully believable as Superman and Clark. Bosworth is not particularly interesting as Lois, certainly NOT Margot Kidder's feisty and spunky intrepid ace reporter, but she's likable and believable and serves her purpose in the story. Overall, even with its problems such as a slowly and strangely paced first 45 minutes, the film is strong, solid, moving, and I loved it, especially the last thrilling and moving half. Singer has convinced me that Superman is certainly back, and boy, have we all been missing him!",1,1,pixel_of_a_pixie,"Jun 27, 2006",

10,Awesome Installment!!!,"Singer did a great job with this latest installment. I was initially nervous that Routh wouldn't be able to fill such large shoes, but he pulled out a flawless performance. Within just a few minutes, I quit trying to compare Christoper Reeve with Routh, and easily accepted Routh as the One. Spacey was a credit to the Luthor character, and Parker Posey provided the film with a fabulous scene stealing sidekick. This will be the benchmark for all future hero-genre movies. Technically, the special effects were right on! The old tag line from the first movie about believing a man can fly really holds up here. All the action sequences were fantastic and the tensions between the main characters kept the drama flowing well. I'm a committed Super-fan!",1,1,robinhood013170,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Overall an entertaining movie which exceeded my expectations,"Don't see it on IMAX 3D! Sure seeing it on the IMAX screen was amazing, but the 3D portions were very poor and I would have much rather seen it on a regular movie screen. They should keep the 3D portions to animated features.When I heard this movie was being made I thought, like most people, how can they replace Christopher Reeve? There was no doubt in my mind that it was a bad idea. Then I saw the first trailer and I couldn't help but be excited. I was worried the movie would not live up to my hopes and expectations, but I was wrong. The action sequences are amazing and adrenaline pumping, although some aren't remotely believable, but who cares, this is Superman we're talking about. Kevin Spacey did a great job with his limited/lacking script for Lex Luthor.Some of the critics say Brandon Routh brought no personality to Superman, and I find it difficult to believe they didn't cast him just because he resembles Reeve. Routh must have done a lot of research on Reeve's portrayal of Superman, because he pulled it over extremely well.Overall the movie had a great balance of action, humour, and cheese to it. The romance portion dragged a bit, but I have to assume the director did this to build the story for future Superman movies. I loved it and will likely see it again on the regular big screen.",2,2,livelyjay,"Jun 27, 2006",

4,"A fun film, but the plot is more of an excuse than a reason.","Superman returns to earth and Lois is getting a Pulitzer prize for writing the article ""does earth really need Superman?"" it's a movie about Superman, of course earth needs him, so really there is no question. Excellent effects and the 3-D Imax is amazing. Lois Lane is married and now Superman is back, they really gray out Superman's morals by having him tempting a married woman, though he does keep his distance... by making her fall for him again. I haven't seen a Superman movie where Superman has fewer lines than this one. Good acting by all but the story seems pulled in too many directions to fully capatilize on any one dramatic plot point. Too much hype may be the culprit for my low rating. I'll have to watch Superman 2 again to really get the Lois and Clark relationship, but I do remember the Fortress of Solitude scene that spawned a Asmatic super boy that could have been developed into a cool story instead of an after thought. Lex Luthor wants his Land, Superman wants to be wanted, and Lois wants too much from Super hero Dads. Oh, and never put Sir Richard Branson in cameo roles, it makes it look like he bought his way on to the set to surprise all the viewers.

7,The Holy Side Of Clark,"I saw ""Superman Returns"" last night in a plush Hollywood movie theater surrounded by devoted Superman fans. That in itself, I must admit, was part of the fun. Brandon Routh is breathtakingly, impossibly beautiful and you can trust that in a Bryan Singer movie stunning looking people will populate the screen. Here, the hero with the sensational eyelashes, works wonders in every single way. There is a hint of Superman as Jesus. Cucifixtion, resurrection, from Father to Son and I bought it wholeheartedly because it deserves to be bought. Kevin Spacey is a fun arch villain. There is nobody as convincingly evil as Kevin Spacey. It was strange, however, to see the lovely Kate Bosworth who played Sandra Dee to Spacey's Bobby Darin in ""Beyond The Sea"" to be so extremely at odds with each other but I bought Luthor and Lane much more than Darin and Dee. Ultimately Superman Returns is a classy, classic rendition of a perennial tale by one of the most successful aesthetes working on film today. Recommend it.",312,270,seanodartofilm,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,"SUPERMAN RETURNS--man, does he ever !!!","Whimsical, exciting and bold, SUPERMAN RETURNS brought back magic to me I haven't felt since I was a little kid watching Christopher Reeve in the original films. Brandon Routh was REMARKABLE in the part! He bears such an uncanny resemblance to Reeve in the film, it gave me chills! There could not have been a better choice for Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther. He plays the villain with such suave finesse, giving the character a little bit of his own charm. Kate Bosworth plays Lois as a new woman. She is engaged with a child now, so it is assumed the way she played Lois had to be changed with the times. She is much less vulnerable in this one; much prettier and smarter than Margot Kidder's Lois. Perhaps one of the film's best surprises was Parker Posey as Luther's sidekick, Kitty. Posey is one of today's most underrated actresses. She always has a natural magnetism and she was delightful. The film obviously tries hard not to upset fans of the old Superman, and gives us just enough of the old to balance with the new. The film's only flaw is the last 30 minutes. It is a bit attenuous, could have been 20 minutes shorter, but I loved every minute of it anyways. Being a part of the ""old"" Superman generation, I have to say that I am pleasantly enticed and I actually hope for more to come. Grade: A",2,2,mikeylovesgregg,"Jun 27, 2006",

1,Extremely DIsappointing,"It saddens me to say this but unfortunately, I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed with this film - it's definitely full of action and is entertaining, but it severely lacks substance. I felt the performances were weak, especially Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth. Kevin Spacey was the saving grace of the film. The CGI effects were too over the top and I walked out of the screening feeling unsatisfied given the amount of hype. All I can say is the warm sensation I used to get while watching Christopher Reeve was non existent and everything that embodies superman was somehow lost in translation. Sorry to disappoint y'all, believe me I was disappointed too...I had such high hopes for Superman Returns. :-(",13,16,smarkel21,"Jun 27, 2006",
6,Singer is all over the place.,"Don't think I'll be adding anything new with my comments, but unfortunately, I belong to the camp that was disappointed. While SR is by no means a bad film, it certainly wasn't as good as it could have been. Singer is all over the place with his themes. Simultaneously, he's trying to pay homage to Donner and Action Comics while also alluding to a greater myth. It's doable, but Superman's humanity is somehow lost amidst an over-worked love story. Routh, who actually does a decent job inheriting Reeve's mantle, spends most of the film moping. Spacey wasn't as bad as I had thought, but he's given barely a page of dialogue and his Lex Luthor never emerges beyond a uni-dimensional foil. Again, this is not a bad film, but with $250mm they could have made an amazing film. Singer does demonstrate the ability to create amazing scenes (the airplane scene, the Atlas scene where Supes catches the Daily Planet globe, the Messianic fall of Supes back to Earth), but let's hope the next venture is better.",6,7,J. Ryan,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,He's so much more bad ass then I expected,"OK so I am not a huge Superman fan, I mean I've seen all the flicks and I know all about the character and I watch Smallville. (I know) So I kind of expected to only sort of like this film. I knew I would be able to judge weather it was good or bad regardless of my enjoyment of it though. Man I was wrong. I loved it! I really must stress that I am way more of a fan of a hero like Batman with all his attitude, and while the first set of films staring Christopher Reeve were definitely brilliant, there was always something missing from them for me. I always felt like though everyone in them did an excellent job and all, I don't know, something about them felt off. This movie has changed all that for me. I am not saying it is better or that Superman I is bad but setting this one up using Superman I and II as a sort of background really worked for me. I don't want to tell you about the plot or anything. I just want to express how impressed I am by all the people involved. Brandon Routh does a superb job of playing Clark Kent as a guy no one really thinks about, he's not the bumbling idiot or anything, just goofy enough that no one wants to notice him. He plays Superman as a more confident and powerful personality (obviously, he's Superman after all) He does this with such grace though, it's really something to see. Kate Bosworth is a really decent Lois Lane, she's not as hard as some reviews have said, she makes sense to me. Obviously Kevin Spacey steals the show sometimes, his Lex Luthor is evil and scary and smart ass all together and it's great, and Parker Posey is a great sidekick to him. I was more surprised about the amount of genuine laughs this flick had then anything else. I really did laugh out loud several times, and I teared up too. It's a great movie it doesn't feel as long as it is and it is one of the most beautifully shot things I have seen in quite some time. There are several iconic scenes that are filmed so beautifully it made me gasp. I highly recommend this film to both young and old.",1,7,lisin,"Jun 27, 2006",

3,A tear came to my eye as well...,"But for a completely different reason. This movie made ""The Lake House"" look like an action flick. Besides the boring storyline, this movie tries way to hard to be like the movies before it, and it comes out as an old, dried up, done before version of the big, blue boyscout. With a lack of any real fighting, and the fact that Lex Luthor is in the movie for a total of 15 minutes (maybe), this movie might appeal to extreme die-hard fans of the old films, but should come up short to anyone with any level of intelligence.If you are a fan of plot holes, menacing plans of the real-estate kind, and men lifting things, this movie is for you. But, if you crave an actual storyline and good acting, I recommend you watch Batman Begins if you want a newer DC Comic movie. At least Batman fought someone.I will give it this.

1,Biggest Waste of money ever!!,"The acting was both bad and in some cases overacted(Spacey), the story was really weak, the action scenes were a joke, the CGI was average, the whole movie was just bad. There is nothing good about this movie. The only redeeming factor about this movie was the Spiderman 3 trailer before it which showed how real superhero movies should look like. I was a huge fan of the first Superman but this movie just spits on the original and does not deserve to have the name Superman in the title. Do not waste your money on this, just wait to it comes to a dollar theater or rent it on DVD. The only way i will recommend this movie is if you see it on IMAX, it is still not a good movie but at least you can see the average action scenes on the IMAX screen. 2/10 rating",17,27,aknddon3,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Great but could've been better,"The first hour is flawless and the opening credits/original score literally sent a shiver down my spine. The Imax 3-D stuff is stunning as well. There were times when it felt as if it was unnecessary however and the movie does drag on a bit at 2:34 of running time... that being said, between the unbelievable special effects sequences and the sheer joy of seeing the Man of Steel back on screen and literally saving the world, i have to say that Bryan Singer and Co. did an amazing job and Brandon Routh is great as Superman. I believed him right away. Lois Lane(Kate Bosworth) seems like a bit of an ice queen throughout, so sympathy for her character is a bit difficult to muster, but her overall performance was great. Kevin Spacey is perfectly evil as Lex Luthor. The use of Brando's voice as Jor-El is another goosebump-inducing concept that works very well.I think any big time fans of the first two Donner films will be not only be pleased but also blown away by the spectacular fashion that earth's greatest hero has been brought back to life. if you aren't a Superman fan, i suggest viewing the first two films before watching this one. It will help you understand what's going on a little bit better, but IS NOT absolutely necessary to enjoy this film which certainly stands on its own.",0,1,conormtl,"Jun 27, 2006",

,"the true Superman- the movie, or the comic book?","Fans of the Superman comic book may find Superman Returns to be a bit of a disappointment. Bryan Singer clearly was a fan of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and this film is made with those films in mind. The lure and mythology, however, of the Superman comic book is, essentially, completely disregarded. Certain decisions are always made when bringing a character as beloved as Superman to the big screen that are necessary in connecting to mainstream audiences, but the two Spiderman films as well as Batman Begins were able to connect to the everyday casual fans while remaining true to the character's roots. Mainstream audiences may enjoy Superman Returns just as they did the original 1978 film, but true Superman buffs will most likely be turned off, perhaps even insulted, by the liberties that Singer and his writers have taken with their beloved character.",1,1,jenk_24,"Jun 27, 2006",
,What Superman Returns Lacks........,"I saw Superman at a sneak preview last night and I was impressed by the directing but the movie lacked character. A retread of the other Supermen's movies that didn't break new ground. I was impressed by Spacey and Parker Posey's performances. The main problem I had with Superman was the fact that no one could tell Clark Kent was Superman. I wish they could have changed the costume that Superman wears. Batman changed his costume to hip modern outfit, why cant Superman? I wish the film could have been darker like Batman and made it stand out from the other films. Singer did a good job at directing but he did a better job with X-men. The other thing was Lois lane who had no sex appeal like Terri Hatcher in Lois and Clark. Lois lane was a Witch who didn't have any kind of appeal or charm. Brandon Routh was no Reeves or Cain. Routh didn't give that good of a performance. He wasn't in the same league as Spacey.

He wasn't a Christopher Reeves, but then again, that's because he's not Christopher Reeves. Routh made Superman his own, and I think he did a great job. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor was genius and his portrayal even shocked me with how far he went with the character. The action scenes were beautiful, as everyone has been raving and the definitely drew me in. This version is darker and grittier, but surprising, I don't remember seeing an ounce of blood. Bryan Singer was able to give it an amazing feel without making it a love letter to violence. Granted, it had it's flaws, but I loved what they did, and with an ending like that, I will be amazingly disappointed if there is not a sequel.Overall, 8/10.",0,1,cvwilson,"Jun 27, 2006",

8,"""You wrote that the world doesn't need a saviour, but every day I hear people crying for one. ""","Let me just say that it's good, its not mediocre or bad, but its surely good. Everyone i went with (i went to it with 25 people) seemed to have liked it more than i did, which was surprising.The acting was one of the things i thought was top notch, not perfect like the 1978 and 1980 films. Brandon Routh effortlessly became Superman, he looks like Reeve, and sometimes even sounds like him. He was a bit young, but it was very easy to overlook. Kate Bosworth was a good Lois Lane, shes no Margot Kidder, but she was above average. I blame the writing of the character and how Singer directed her, but she was still good. As you would imagine, Kevin Spacey, while barely misses some of the great lines of Gene Hackman, has a wonderful time and does Lex Luthor extremely well. He has a lot of great lines, just for some reason, the magic of Hackman is missing, but can be easily excused. Sam Huntington does a great job as Jimmy Olsen and somehow catches a little magic that McClure just didn't catch, so for once, a cast improvement is made. The rest of the cast does their job well.The action... not much of it. If you expecting Superman to fly around the whole movie tossing stuff around like a Spiderman or Batman film, you are mistaking. While there is enough action to keep everyone satisfied, and the special effects are top notch, the movie runs a bit long for the amount of action it actually has.The comedy... thank goodness, the one thing i loved about Superman was the comedy. It's back and i loved it here. Singer was able to capture the light hearted side of the characters and really play with different situations. There is nothing that surpasses the Otis and Luthor arguments from the first films, but they come very close.The story is great. Lots of twists and stuff you wouldn't expect.So... what is wrong with this movie? What does it miss? It really dosen't miss anything at all. There is nothing bad in this movie... but i will tell you what harms the film the most. PACING. To my surprise, Singer seems to be the one that messed up a little much this time around. While everything he directed was top notch, the editing however was not. The film is top heavy, with great pacing in the first 2 acts mostly, the last act goes on too long and should have been edited differently. Don't get me wrong, the quality of it was good, but people were waiting for the ending to happen, and even with it did, nothing remarkable happened. The ending wasn't bad, it was a little disappointing thats all. It was underwhelming compared to the roller-coaster ride of a movie it was, though there is a little detail of the ending i will not reveal, but it made it kinda worth it.Now... like i said... a lot of people i was with disagreed with me on this, but thats how i saw it. Everyone clapped for the ending, which surprised me, considering how much of a slow ending it was. It was a great movie, one of the best in a while, exceeds the quality of Lester's Superman II cut that we all love or hate, but never is able to surpass Donner's remarkable original film.I give it 8 out of 10 stars. A great, fantastic, awesome film, but somehow does not meet the standard of the first Superman film.",0,5,joefino69,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Very good Sequel,"Superman was going to be a very difficult movie to make; for both the actors and the crew. Comparing it to the original superman with Christopher Reeves, it fell short, but only a little short. As a sequel, standing alone, it was fantastic. Kevin Spacey was a perfect cast for Lex Luthor and did a wonderful job. I also liked Parker Posey as Mrs. Kitty. She brought some comic relief to the film and did a god job. Kate Bonsworth did an average Lois Lane; I would have liked to see someone else playing the part, like maybe Kate Beckinsale. Brandon Routh who??? I don't think anyone else could have done any better job than he did. He was the next best Superman you could hope to see on the big screen, paying homage to Christopher Reeves. I liked everything about this film and would definitely recommend seeing it. I am going to see it again tonight.",0,5,av6637,"Jun 27, 2006",
8,"Met, but not exceeding expectations","Hands down, this was the best Superman movie (Visually speaking). Singer should take pride in what I saw was a tribute to the first 2 Superman films. I will say the movie was great. For the most part, it kept a pretty good pace and the updated actors fit perfectly into their roles. Routh was perfect for the title role and Spacey, being one of the best actors of our time, was spot on as Luther. I didn't care too much for Bosworth's Lois Lane, she seemed so awkward and uncomfortable in that part. I'm sure she would have made a decent Lane, had she just chosen a different direction for her character. From the opening credits to the final scene, I felt like this was Singer's way of saying ""Thanks for those first 2 Superman movies, now let's add some up to date special effects!"" I think this movie set up what is going to be an amazing series for this generation to enjoy as much as we did with the Reeves/Donner films.",0,5,darensfriend,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,"Despite a rehashed story line, perhaps the best Superman ever done on film.","I just saw this movie as a late night sneak preview, and thought that it was the best Superman treatment that I have ever seen done on film.I'm old enough that I have seen both Chris Reeve and George Reeves step into this role and do it honor, so I figured it might take a few minutes to warm up to Brandon Routh's take on the character, but I can honestly say that he won me over very quickly, and I think he has done an incredible job which would have made his now departed fellow actors proud.Routh has piercing blue eyes in the film (apperently CGI'ed that way, but who cares?), which can be steel hard one moment, and lipid pools of hidden emotions the next (hinting at the burden that the 'Man of Steel' must carry).The contours of his face also lend themselves well to portraying both the 'mild mannered reporter' Clark Kent AND the somewhat more serious and dour Superman.Louis Lane is played by another relative newcomer Kate Bosworth; and Kate did a damn fine job in portraying a Louis Lane who is conflicted, but deeply in love with Superman.Lex Luthor is played in the film by the Acadamy Award winning actor Kevin Spacey, who lends the character a much more serious edge than Gene Hackman did in the last series of Superman films back in the 70's and 80's. Spacey also did a very good job, though I have to admit that one or two of his yelling blustering tirades went a little 'over the top' for my tastes, and didn't fit my personal mental picture of that character, who I thought should have been just a bit more quietly sinister and menacing (on the other hand, Lex is supposed to be an INSANE evil genus, so who am I to say?). Overall, Spacey's performance is intense, energetic, and original, and is perfectly in sync with the somewhat more serious dramatic tone that the director and producers were trying to create for the film.The CGI work and special effects in the film are also very well done, certainly some of the best I have ever seen in a recent film.Although I enjoyed the film a lot, and DO recommend it highly, there is one area where it falls a little below my expectations, and that is in the quality of the script.This is not because it's not suspenseful, or the guys who wrote it couldn't string together some incredible action sequences (they did), but because they also used a lot of rehashed plot threads from previous films. Guys! ; This is NOT the X-men where there were originally NO prior movies, so it needed a newer more ORIGINAL treatment (like the one in the 'Batman Begins' film).I don't know whether it was the writers or producers decision, but the decision to use a 'rehashed' Lex Luthor storyline from a previous film, when the Superman mythos spans hundreds of stories EACH with the potential to be adapted into a film, was a BLINDINGLY STUPID choice that weakened an otherwise excellent film.In fairness, the telling of this new adaptation is quite different, and I did find the film, suspenseful, interesting and engaging, I just think that the writers could have done a much better screenplay if they had pushed the story in a more original direction.So this is why, even though I did say above that this was perhaps the best Superman I had ever seen done on film, it only rates nine stars and not a perfect 10.",0,5,EyeOnMovies,"Jun 27, 2006",

9,Superman Returns and New Throwback,"Superman Returns what can i say i have never been so excited about seeing a movie ever. I've watched Smallville over the past few years and though a Superman movie would ruin the show for the fact that the show wasn't over and that it was using new actors. But then i heard Bryan Singer wan directing it and that changed most of it I trusted the genius behind X2, then i saw the Preview and Marlon Brondos voice as Jor-El over the Krypton Theme was amazing and made me loose all doubts. The movie itself was well put together, if u like the original Christopher Reves and Richard Donner version you will not be disappointed. This movie has a very similar opening sequence and the music is nostalgic. I had the biggest smile on my face when the opening sequence started. Through out the movie there are many nods to the original and even the old comics and George Reeves version.Overall the acting was Superb you have to trust a director who basically discovers Hugh Jackman. Brandon Routh was great as Superman Kal-El and Clark Kent. He showed emotion when it was needed and never overacted at all. Kate Bosworth has to be the hottest Lois Lane and although she lacked that sass from the original she was believable as a changed and conflicted Lois Lane. Lex Lex Lex, did anyone play Lex Lutor because he was perfect, he was sinister and comical when he needed to be. Kevin Spacey was a great Lex Luthor and he wasn't like Gene Hackmans campy Lex, he was more like Smallville's and the comic books Lex Luthor which i liked. ANd All the supporting actors were on point Parker Posey was funny when she needed to be, James Mardsen was actually likable in this movie, (I didn't like him in Xmen or the Notebook), Sam Huntington (from Not Another Teen Movie) he was funny as Jimmy Olsen. This movie was so great on many levels visually, action wise (although don't expect too much), and most important of all story wise. The story is great and it is very detailed so everything has a reason it is happening. Overall this is a great restart or should i say continuation of the Superman Movie Franchise.",0,1,truballer4life2k,"Jun 27, 2006",

8,ranks right among the best super-hero films,"Bryan Singer's ""re-quel"", if you will, of Donner's late 70's Super flick is a success. He manages to bring freshness to the source material while paying homage to the look and feel of the Salkind produced classics. We can see Singer's affection right from the nostalgic opening credits, all the way through to the final shot. But we can also see how the story has been updated to modern sensibilities. Brandon Routh is more than able to usher in the character into the new millennium, and Spacey's Lex Luthor is spot on. In fact all the supporting cast is quite good, although Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane suffers from looking a little too young to be an experienced reporter and have a 5-year old child. Nonetheless, the action is appropriately Super looking, and the chemistry between Routh and Bosworth is believable enough to carry the emotional heft of the screenplay. Definitely a satisfying and worthy addition to the stable of modern superhero classics like Spider-Man 2 and X2. Can't wait to see the sequel!",0,1,EagleDave,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,"After as much time, Superman Returns","It's far better of which it had been able to imagine, it enchanted to me. The film fulfills all my expectations, Bryan Singer is a genius and Brandon Routh is the new Superman. With respect to the special effects they are incredible. It's without a doubt the film of Superman that we were hoping to be able to see and some of the scenes of effects are the best ones than never they have been seen in a cinema. The flight scenes are very credible but I liked plus those of Matrix Revolutions. James Mardsen made really worry me to me about a personage who in principle would not have to be there; Parker Posey robs all their scenes; Eva Marie Saint was penetrating and magnificent; Frank Langella, a really fantastic Perry White; Sam Huntington, the best Jimmy of all the times; Kevin Spacey, excellent, seemed to previous but the better and much more cruel one. It's easily the most sinister Lex never seen in screen, a delight to see; Kate Bosworth is deep, obstinate and fighter, as Lois must be. And Brandon Routh IS Superman. He's very similar to Cristopher Reeve, although it needs to its greatness and originality. The chemistry between Brandon and Kate is enormous. The personalities of Clark and Superman were more defined, they really make you see as if they were different people and the special effects are outside this world. It seems that they used Kriptonian technology to do them. The history, script and stage scene of the film, are the one that all we want to see, and so deep that I take it inside.",2,1,Dale_yayo,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Wow..,"No spoilers here. Just a review. Batman is my favorite hero. Superman is my 2nd favorite. Quite simply, Superman Returns is awesome. When I go to a movie, I want to be taken someplace. I want to forget about my troubles for a couple hours and put my focus into just getting lost in a movie. At first I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I liked everything Bryan Singer had done thus-far. Everything from his previous movies to his picking the cast for this movie to the costume changes. This movie just got to me. I laughed and I cried. It made me feel everything that I wanted to feel. Bryan Singer had a vision and he brought it to the table and he just kicks ass with it. The shots he created and the feeling he brought to the screen are perfect. Wait until you see the first time Superman actually comes back. Easily the best Superman scene shot on film. The main guy, Brandon Routh nailed it. He wasn't to over the top as Clark Kent and he was just the right amount of klutziness mixed with coolness. As Superman, he embodied the role. He became Superman. From his first appearance to his last one, I felt for him. The whole idea that this person from another planet would sacrifice so much and go through all this internal and external battling should speak to many people. Kate Bosworth also did a great job. She was a little more damsel in distress then expected but a solid job nonetheless. Kevin Spacey owned this movie. I hated him so much for what he was doing that I wanted to see a sequel right then and there and have Superman beat his ass. He just became this evil tyrant and it will stick in my mind for sometime. All the characters after the main 3....Eve Marie Saint, Frank Langella, Sam Huntington who was amazing, Parker Posey, James Mardsen who had a scene where he almost outshines Superman in his act of heroism, and of course Marlon Brando who in basically his last role made the film connect to the past even more, pulled off a great supporting cast who will all hopefully be coming back for more. There are also some great scenes with the little kid which at first I though I wasn't going to like but it then grew on me. I'll say also that the crowd I saw it with at the 10:00 showing on Tuesday, applauded many times. Superman has most certainly returned.

10,A legendary and mighty adaptation of Superman.....,"I came back from seeing this movie at its first public screening, this afternoon at the local theatre. In my opinion, this glamorous and mighty adaptation of the Man of Steel, is nothing but flawless.Brandon Routh portrayed Superman miraculously in his first major starring role of his career as an actor. He, like Christopher Reeve before him, maintained the balance between the clumsy, mild-mannered reporter, Clark Kent, as well as Superman himself. Kudos to Brandon for his contributions to this immortal character. Kate Bosworth cleanly portrayed the ever persistent Lois Lane, although I felt that it needed a little brushing up. This is because she only started her career several years back, and Margot Kidder, in my opinion, performed her role slightly more demanding and persistent to find out who Superman's alter ego is. This Superman film in my opinion, ranks ahead of Superman, and Superman 2. Good job Singer, you directed a masterpiece.",1,1,harel619,"Jun 27, 2006",

7,"Flawed, but thoroughly entertaining","There is a wonderful form of escapism that a good comic book movie should bring. I mean a type in which you do not sit around and attempt to nit-pick some of the trivial questions to cheapen the film's authenticity. Superman Returns captures that emotion perfectly. By no means does this film feel like a fairy tale, but but it it lets you sit back and smile. In short, this is great film to see for pure entertainment. This film is not perfect, but it is still very fulfilling. Some can criticize it for being a bit too fast paced at first or for getting a bit too sappy towards the end. The film however, makes up for this with its beautiful action, masterful villainy, strong acting, and solid character development. Overall, it is fun for anyone who just feels like watching a movie for the sake of having a good time. TINY SPOILERS Starting with the actors, the first observation you can draw is that they all had fun. They all felt an attachment to their characters. Brandon Roeth truly became Superman and Clark Kent perfectly. He was able to make Kent into a caring man who means well both as Clark Kent and Superman. As Clark Kent, the greatest challenge of his is coping with the reality that his romantic life with Lois is be over. Upon coping with Lois as a mother who has moved from her Superman/Clark days he must learn to accept this loss that came with his reasons for leaving. As Superman however, he still realizes the significance in his role as a world savior who must bring Metropolis and the world back in order. That is where the best performance comes in with Kevin Spacey as Lex. Now this was a spectacular performance as expected. Did he play Kevin Spacey? Yes and no. Again, he did his generic act in many parts; a sarcastically energetic, smart-Alec. His passion for genuinely insulting everything was very prominent in this role. Thst element worked well for the part, but playing another Lester Burnham was not the reason I liked him. He manages to bring both the evil element as Lex and the comical element. Things as simple as calling Lois' name while he is brushing his teeth gave him a charmingly evil persona. He also brought the right element of naive arrogance I think comic book super villains typically need. He manages to play a character who can beat Superman and does in fact come seriously close, but can not quite manage. The weakest acting performance, I felt was Kate Bosworth. I did not mind her, but she did not manage to replace Margot Kidder in my eyes. Christoper Reeve and Gene Hackman did performances I will always appreciate and love, but Roeth and Spacey were comparable if not superior to them. Bosworth could not say the same. Her performance was not bad, but it was nothing more than I would have expected. I like the static development of Lois in the film, but Boswarth I felt was too much one emotion by one. First she was bitter and sad in denial; then she was irritatingly motherly (and wait until you see her son in this movie). I never really felt much for her though. Then of course, Lex needs to have a really annoying side kick. Can I blame Parker Posey for her performance? Bryan Singer wanted a character to seriously irritate the audience. It worked. Was she funny? Not really. Spacey played well off of her though, so she was fine. The plot? It's Superman. What do you want, an Oscar-caliber screenplay? Lex wants to sink the United States by creating a new entire continent that he will raise out of the water with with crystals to sell land and create fear in the rest of the world. He is a bitter man who has inherited the entire estate of an incredibly wealth woman who has just died. And now he needs more money. I guess he is not a man to believe that the best revenge is living well. Sounds like a Superman plot to me.The best part of the film is the action. Every shot of Superman flying to the rescue whether he is saving a plane or taking out criminals is fabulous. Yes, you know Superman can accomplish any of these tasks in a pinch. The most exciting element of each action sequence is waiting for him to appear. The the action scenes will just make you want to cheer along with everyone else watching.The first major weakness in the film was less of a problem than I thought it was going to be at first. The first few major elements of what Kevin Dougherty wanted to cover in the story felt a little rushed. I felt that Superman just reappeared to quickly. I like the plot in a film to really get going after I get a solid attachment to the characters. This film is still a follow-up to 80's Superman movies, but that franchise had been on hiatus for nineteen years. It was worth reintroducing the plot a tad more. This however, became less problematic as the film developed and got more into the new material. The film's greatest weakness was the sap; especially toward the end with with everyone'es emotional love for Superman they showed. As far as specific detail, that is for you the reader to find by watching the film. I loved this film as a whole! It was exciting, and thoroughly fulfilling in virtually all the crucial elements of a fun action film. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes campy action and fun characters.

4,Doesn't do Donner Justice,"This movie steals a lot of it's plot lines and even several of it's lines of dialog from the 1978 Richard Donner version. What it should have taken instead is the approach, which it misses entirely. The tag-line for the '78 film was ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly"" and this summed up the film's attempt to bring verisimilitude to the story. To make you believe in the world that Superman lived in, was to enable you to invest in the story emotionally. If you don't believe in the world he lives in, you don't care what happens to it, or the characters within it. This new movie brings up a lot of promising ideas, and then it doesn't explore them at all, dragging them down to the mundane. As seen in the trailer, Luthor enters the Fortress of Solitude, and is granted access to the accumulated scientific knowledge from dozens of galaxies. And all the writers can think to have him do with it is one stupid, limited, unimaginative thing. And the nature of the Kryptonian technology itself, borrowed from the original film, is not explored beyond one small aspect. There are some great action scenes and special effects, but the last act of the film falls flat. There is nothing to fear, or root for. It just hangs there. Wish Singer had made X3 instead, which would have improved under his guidance, and wish someone more daring had taken on Superman. One word review: Mundane",25,30,Sblake238,"Jun 27, 2006",

8,Singer Delivers a Great Movie,"I loved this movie, as does most everyone else it seems. Geat effects, good story, good acting, pretty much a full package. Basically, Superman comes back after a five year journey to the remains of his home world Krypton. Lex Luthor, played extremely well by Kevin Spacey, maybe the best Lex ever, also find Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and lets just say nothing good comes from that. Lois Lane has a child and fiancé, and this of course creates some inner conflict for Clark and Superman. I would say Kate Bosworth, who plays Lois, is the weakest part of the movie. It isn't that she is a bad actress, quite the opposite really, but she is a twenty-three year old (and she looks twenty-three) playing a thirty-something mom of a five year old, and it just isn't convincing. She acts a great Lois, has just the right amount of attitude, but through out the movie you are just too aware of how young she looks. But, she is hot as hell, so who really cares, right? Now, on to the big guy, Brandon Routh. So many have labeled him as a ""Superboy"" rather than ""Superman"" and for a while, I agreed. I don't anymore. This guy does look a bit young, as does Bosworth, but he is an excellent Superman and Clark Kent, and to me, is a better Superman than Christopher Reeves, but to be fair, I was never a huge fan of Reeves's Superman. After watching this movie, all my fears about his capabilities as Superman. He looks great in the suit, a lot buffer than photos make it look, and his Clark Kent is dead on. He is the perfect mild mannered, clumsy reporter he should be. I am really looking forward to seeing him play Supe's in th inevitable sequels.The effects are great in this movie. When we see Superman flying, it looks real, completely real. When I first saw Spider-man swinging through New York some years back, I thought ""that looks really cool, but you can tell it is computer generated."" Not with this movie. The scenes where he saves the burning planes is amazing, it looks real, and is extremely exciting. Everything in this movie looks great, and does our most popular hero a fine amount of justice.People breathed a sigh of relief when Brian Singer (X-Men, X-Men 2) was slated to direct Superman, after his outstanding work on the X-Men movies (in which his absence on the third is apparent), and that sigh was warranted. He did a great job. He knew exactly what he wanted to do with the movie, and exactly where he wanted to take it. This guy should write a book on how to do Super Hero movies, because he is a master, and knowing he will be doing the sequels is comforting. You can tell he loves these characters as much as we all do, and tries to make the movie he thinks most people want to see, rather than the movie he wants to see.

8,"Rush to the theater, folks!","My family watched the first show this morning in our local IMAX theater. Now that I've calmed down a little bit, I can write here.Truth be told, I had incredibly high expectations for this movie, and they were met...mostly. The reason I gave the movie an 8 instead of a 10 is that I don't think Kevin Spacey makes the best Lex Luthor; he didn't really intimidate me, if you know what I mean. Then again, maybe they should have cast someone less known in that role too. I am so accustomed to watching Michael Rosenbaum play Lex in Smallville, were he really IS the man you love to hate, that Spacey disappointed me. Bring on the hate mail, Spacey lovers!Anyway, I would never spoil a movie for someone. The movie is great, it draws you in and, of course, the special effects are awesome. However, all I really want to say is this. If, when you hear the first stanzas of that famous Superman score, you do not start bawling because:1. Christopher Reeves is gone, AND2.

6,"Look, up in the air! It's another jumbled, loud, poorly-conceived blockbuster!","All the right ingredients should have made the ideal superhero movie, but sadly the chefs instead cooked up a remake that doesn't equal the fun or quality of Superman I and II.The new film attempts to humanize the story of Superman with quick snapshots of his isolation and longing for Lois Lane. However, they are all dashed in favor of special affects that whoosh by so fast the audience can't even distinguish what's going on. Is it a bird? A plane? No, it's just a blur of red and blue mixed with deafening digital explosions. The only real ""whoa"" moments that showcase Superman's talents are thankfully done in slow-motion. It's an old trick popularized by the Matrix, but is used wisely here.The new Man of Steel, Brandon Routh looks the part, but needs a few more acting lessons before he should be able to helm such a heavy responsibility. Lois Lane, played by Kate Bosworth, never works up a good rapport or chemistry between her character and Superman, and she hardly shares a word with Clark Kent. His nemesis, Lex Luthor a la Kevin Spacey, doesn't have the same maniacal happiness shown by Gene Hackman.With a running time of 2 1/2 hours, you would think time would be made for a better story and to fill some of the maddening plot holes. Why was Clark gone for five years? Nobody cares to ask. What did Superman find of his home world in that time? People ask, but get interrupted.

They spent YEARS in development on this. . .oh, maybe that's the problem. I don't blame the actors or the director for my problems with this -- I actually think the movie was very well cast and well shot. I loved many of the visuals in the story. What bothered me, though, was the writing. The issue wasn't with the dialogue (which was suitably cheesy - Superman's line after the plane sequence rivaled some of the best Reeves lines and deliveries in any of the other movies) but rather with the weak story. Why couldn't there have been MORE in this story than a tacked on ""Is he the father or not"" story to the ""ooh, Lex wants to take over the world...?"" It just didn't carry enough weight to truly herald back the greatest superhero of the last century. Superman isn't supposed to have the angst of the Spiderman or Batman, and this movie didn't even pretend to that, which I admire. However, what made Superman 1 and 2 so great were the plots and real motivations of the characters for their actions, something I found lacking in this film. Here's hoping this is just a bridge movie to a GREAT sequel with a STRONG story -- the actors and visuals are lined up -- no give us a REAL tale to watch!",1,0,jasonflum,"Jun 27, 2006",

His Lex Luthor is much more evil and sinister, while still retaining the humor of Gene Hackman's original. The Man of Steel himself also did an incredible job. He resembles Christopher Reeve in so many ways, I almost forgot it was a different actor. Kate Bosworth was fantastic as well.I saw the IMAX 3-D version, and I gotta say it was somewhat disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it was great seeing the whole thing on that gigantic screen. You almost feel like you're flying alongside Superman. But the 3-D here feels like a wasted opportunity sometimes. Sure, twenty minutes is better than nothing, but there were other scenes that would've looked great in 3-D as well (Opening Credits for example).

7,"Good movie, but can't quite match the original or even that sequel","I liked Superman Returns. I believe Brandon Routh as Superman was quite decent in the role. Of course he will never be able to equal the performance by Christopher Reeve, but I don't think anyone could for that matter.Still, as I watched Superman Returns I couldn't help but compare it to the 1978 film. Like the original, Superman Returns has a heart, but what it lacks, and that was something that the first film had no problem with, is in action. Sure there were some terrific scenes, but I don't believe there were any that could compare to the 1978 version when Superman saves Lois Lane by super-speeding around the earth to push back time.Another problem with this film was that secondary characters were pushed to the back burner so that the film could focus on Lois Lane and Superman. I would've enjoyed seeing a more sharp witted Perry White and even a more interesting Jimmy Olsen, but we didn't really get any of this. And then there's the part involving a child of Lois Lane's, who could've been used better then he was in this film. Even James Marsden, best known as Cyclops in the X-Men films, is not given enough to work with here even though his character was very likable in this movie.I also found myself comparing Margot Kidder and Kate Bosworth and discovered that I enjoyed Margot Kidder's Lois Lane more even though Kate Bosworth was more attractive. I enjoyed Kidder's wit, sassiness, and awe in that film, but Kate Bosworth didn't have that with Returns. Both her and Routh had good chemistry together though, and that's a plus, but it still can't match Reeve and Kidder who to me are still the ultimate Lois Lane and Superman couple.I would've also liked to have seen a little more originality with the new film. There was too much that was copied from the 1978 film. It was like Singer was playing homage to that film, which is quite a good thing, but he just went a little too over the top. I would've enjoyed seeing more creativity on his part instead of rehashing the older film so much. I guess that's why I enjoyed Batman Begins more than Superman Returns, because Christopher Nolan added a lot of his own creativity to the Batman film.With all that aside, I still enjoyed Superman Returns. It looked good and crisp, and the characters were not at all that bad for what they were all given to work with. It may not be the best comic adaption of Superman, but it was still pretty good and worth seeing. If I had to compare it with other comic book movies, it would fall somewhere between X3 and XMen 1. X2 was better.",0,1,freaky_dave,"Jun 27, 2006",

The always delightful Parker Posey delivered another charming, funny performance and the leads, the very young Brandon Routh as Superman and Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, could not have been better. For the first time in a long time, Kevin Spacey was given a meaty role, that of the villainous Lex Luthor, that he could knock out of the park and he did. Spacy's performance was spot-on. What a deliciously funny, evil, but incompetent bad guy Spacey made here! The special effects were great but, more importantly, the film told an exciting and satisfying story.

8,Superman comes back to earth to confront his past.,"This movie in my opinion is very respectful of what has come before it and yet has its own flavor and style. For those who enjoyed the Christopher Reeve franchise you will also like this new version. It pays tribute to the good parts of what Reeve did with the character and for the image of Superman. The style of this movie has a texture and look that is in a way a result of the influence of director Singer. Some of the look is reminiscent of X-Men elements, but that is where the similarities end. Singer is very aware of the importance that these comic book influenced movies are the fans of those comic books. With all of the recent incarnations and other influences to the Superman saga this one stays true to the movie sensibilities of the treatment to the characters and storyline to a degree. Brandon Routh does a wonderful job making the character his own, while keeping some of the character choices Reeve innovated. Spacey's Lex Luther is fun and menacing. He finds a way to take a character that could become too light and is able to keep the fun and also be a real threat to truth, justice and the American way. Overall this new Superman is a great addition to its history and is refreshing in a time when most superhero movies seem to want to celebrate the dark characters.

8,It's All About Nostalgia in 'Superman Returns',"It sure can't be easy to live up to audience expectations set by movies generations have grown up with like 'Star Wars'. However, I think 'Superman Returns' succeeds where the new 'Star Wars' movies failed. After languishing for what seemed an eternity in development hell, 'Superman Returns',directed by Bryan Singer, is a credit to Singer and his crew, and quite a marvel to behold.Like with 'Star Wars', audiences have had more than twenty years to process, scrutinize and savor every moment of the 1978 movie version directed by Richard Donner and starring the unpretentious Christopher Reeve. In fact, I found myself at once nostalgic hearing the familiar score by John Williams and from watching the flying blue credits preceding the film. And for but a brief moment, I even expected Christopher Reeve to appear on the screen—just as he was remembered.Though Christopher Reeve did not appear, his presence was definitely felt. A relative unknown, Brandon Routh had an uncanny knack for capturing that which audiences loved about Reeve and adding some of his own personality to the dual roles of Clark Kent and Superman. Even Kate Bosworth brought her own to the role of Lois Lane, made famous on celluloid by Margot Kidder. Her Lois Lane appeared more conflicted than frazzled the way Kidder's Lane always appeared, and it was a welcome and fresh approach. Equally notable was the continuity of a story line from the second film of the original movie run; a perfect segue to this updated rendition. And as the CGI effects of this version dazzle and amaze, the third and fourth installments of the former franchise are easily dismissed like a bad dream.While in recent years iconic comic heroes have been brought to the screen with flair and heart, I think for the updated Superman franchise, the best is yet to come. Though it's clear the film is an homage to the director of the1978 version—with everything from the visual to the spoken echoing its former incarnation—Kevin Spacey's characterization of Lex Luthor was tiresome, trite, and just plain distracting. It was especially disappointing considering the complexity Michael Rosenbaum has given the television version in the 'Smallville' series. That Lex Luthor would have been a wonderfully frightening addition, considering the heart and soul of the 'Superman Returns' script; one in which takes pride in its portrayal of a more complex protagonist, and could have had an equally complex adversary. Instead of wondering what other scheme Luthor might concoct in future installments, I found myself wishing for an indefinite reprieve.But where this movie succeeds in revisiting the celluloid version introduced nearly thirty years ago is the wonderful marriage of special effects and storytelling. This relationship invokes a welcome nostalgia for the old while appreciating the new, complete with a story full of layers and action. Though the length of the movie may turn off some movie-goers, running at 154 minutes, it's well worth viewing for two reasons: first, for fans of the Christopher Reeve Superman, it will leave them feeling nostalgic for the kid who first sat before the giant screen hearing the resounding musical score and watching Reeve fly effortlessly as no one had done before. Secondly, even if you're not a fan of the original movie series, the ease with which Routh's Superman defies gravity, and the impossible task of stepping into roles made cinematically famous three decades ago handled capably, it makes it all too easy to get caught up in the Superman lore.Here's hoping this Superman stays a little while longer. And unlike the last set of films, only gets better with age.",1,1,mrlecara,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Superman is a superb ride.,"Superman was not a disappointment. Aside from the Mr Mom who brought his irritable whining toddler to the afternoon matinée, it was one of the best times I have had in a theater in a few years. My date and I are ready to go find the nearest IMAX theater and see it again NOW. Of course if you wanted to you could pick it apart, but he movie didn't lag for long. It was not as gruelingly predictable as much of the rest of the crap coming out of Hollywood. I was a big fan of the first 2 Xmen films, and was a bit put off with the last one. Too bad Singer bailed on that project. I hope there is an X4 and A Superman Returns Again and he directs. Brandon Routh delivered. Props to Parker Posey! The audience loved her.

8,A triumphant return,"Saw it last night and I gotta say, wow. While the movie ran slightly longer than I felt necessary, Bryan Singer absolutely knocked it out of the park on this one. Brandon Routh consistently met the demands of playing the boldly brave Superman but also the awkwardly shy and stand-offish Clark Kent. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor...brilliant casting. Aside from that, this movie was also able to maintain the same general tone of its predecessors (III and IV have been nixed from continuity, so essentially this is now being considered the third in the series), and obviously the effects were more incredible. Everybody will dig it. You can't help but get pulled in and wrapped up in the action, especially when Superman is lifting some enormous object while still healing from wounds and you're left sitting there blown away by his incredible feat. There's a major surprise in it that I absolutely refuse to spoil, all I know is that I wanna see what comes next for the Man of Steel, hopefully another villain thrown in the mix, Metallo or Brainiac, but always keep Lex Luthor in as a major player.

The special effects made me feel that Superman was truly real, and that he is waiting to save the day. It is nice to once again realize a world with a Superman. Superman Returns was a awesome follow up to last years Batman Begins. Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey reminded me of the chemistry that Christopher Reeves and Gene Hackman shared back in 1978. This is the best cast superhero movie that has ever been filmed.

I never even saw any of the first four Superman movies. He's too ... perfect. But this movie did exceed my expectations. It really was a load of fun. The CGI was very nicely done. That airplane sequence you guys probably saw in the trailer was spectacular. The scale in which the special effects were done was phenomenal and almost scary in a way. The cinematography was terrific (loved the buildings at night), so basically the movie was a visual feast. The characterization was . . . decent. While I did like Routh's acting, there wasn't really much chemistry between the characters. I thought the kid was cool though, and I did think Luthor was awesome. The evil plot by Luthor was a bit far-fetched. It seemed really unrealistic, but hey, it's a movie. However, this is supposed to be a fun movie, and it really is. There are some references to gods and dieties, and Superman himself is almost portrayed as a god. I liked this a lot. A great movie. 8/10",0,1,YouFightLikeACow,"Jun 27, 2006",

Brandon Routh did a fantastic job as well as Kevin Spacey, who played a very funny Lex Luthor. I enjoyed that the characters remained consistent from the other superman movies. My only problem with this movie is that superman didn't fight enough people. I would have liked for him to punch out more people like he does in the comics and TV shows, but that was OK the movie was still outstanding. The acting was great, the dialog was catchy and remember-able. I recommend it to all and think that you will appreciate the epic tale of one of the best super heroes.",1,1,maulpwns,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Just Awesome,"Wow, I just saw the new movie today and it is absolutely AWESOME. Superman Returns is everything you like about Superman. A little romance, comedy, but lots of action. This version of the man of steel however, is a little bit more serious. Most of the comedy actually comes from Lex Luthor's goons. At first in the movie there isn't much action. Instead, we see all the heroics we love from the man of steel a little later on in the movie, but from then on, it's all superheroics, with the exception of a little romance with Lois Lane in between. All people, young and old should see this version of the man of steel. You won't be disappointed, and this movie will leave you on your seats the whole movie.",1,3,dmkck5,"Jun 27, 2006",
7,Superman Returns not bad but not great - some SPOILERS,"Great: In the all-time pantheon of awesome superhero action scenes, there is the three-way lightsabre fight from Episode I, the shootout in the Lobby from the Matrix, and the airplane rescue from Superman Returns. Utterly amazing. A quick nod to Action Comics #1 in a photo was cool.Good: Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey give excellent performances. I'm biased to Hackman and Reeves, but no complaints are justified here. Singer gets Superman's power level about right (maybe for the first time) and shows it in a convincing manner. The other action scenes are nicely done and they have the same feel as the original film. The special effects are really top notch.Bad: The story itself is not very compelling and the movie feels extremely long. Lex Luthor gets unlimited access to Kryptonian technology and nothing more interesting than using one of the crystals occurs? The effects of Kryptonite seem a lot less overpowering than I would've expected.A couple of nods to the original film would've been plenty. This movie takes wholesale from Superman: the Movie. Entire dialogues, quips, and countless subtleties makes it feel like Singer was torn between remaking the original and making his own film.",1,1,subtlealias,"Jun 27, 2006",
8,"Overall, a solid movie with solid performances","Believe it or not, my only complaint would be the performance by Kate Bosworth, the actress who played Lois Lane. She was annoying, whining and superficial. I could not believe her character, who gave the impression of a twenty-something girl trying to be a grown woman.However, Brandon Routh's portrayal of Superman was nothing less than miraculous. When I first heard that this movie was going to be premiered, I felt it was an insult to Christopher Reeves, whom I have a great respect for as an actor.However, I breathed a sigh of relief by the first 10 minutes of the movie, when Routh appeared as Clark Kent and was as different from Superman as was when played by Reeves.Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey were impeccable.

I know he can act, so what happened. Superman was so pretty it was almost surreal. He looked like one of those drawings in a video game. All in all the movie was enjoyable and transported me for about 45 minutes to another place and time. It was difficult not to think of Christopher Reeves, Gene Hackman, etc. Parker Posey was milk toast when comparing her to the original. Perhaps that is the trick to enjoying the film. Forget all you've seen of Superman before walking into the theater. Then sit down and enjoy the ride. The CGI was fantabulous.

6,"Super in a lot of ways, not all of them good.","Wow, I was one of the first to see Superman Returns at a special ten o'clock show...the crowd was rowdy and ready, and so was I. It was rather confusing to follow at the beginning, I wasn't sure of the time frame, however, it all started playing out. Superman had been gone five years, I am thinking it continues off from part two, however, I can't be totally sure of that. There are many changes when Superman returns, including Louis with a kid and new guy, however, he gets his old job back at the Daily Planet as Clark...he soon must release Superman back into the world, however, as he must make a daring and very cool plane rescue. What to say about the movie? The guy doing Superman is okay just as Reeves was, once again they could have gotten someone better, but then again they also could have gotten someone worse (Cage would have been worse). The movie is super familiar too, and it isn't really all that exciting after the plane rescue which I thought was the highlight of the film. Lex Luther's plan in this one is eerily similar to his plot from the first movie only on a more grand scheme. Same sort of Kryptonite scene, same female sidekick for Lex, the music sounds exactly the same there is just a bit to much that seems recycled from the first Superman movie for me here. I know some will call it a tribute, but I say it is just some lazy writing. The ending is also super long, to long, I just wanted it to end at one point as you knew basically what was going to happen...also most of the action consisted of Superman catching stuff or the ending action scene of throwing something. Let me just say Superman's strength was a bit inconsistent as he labored with smaller objects in earlier scenes. Holes and bad writing in the storyline were aplenty and there were many cutable scenes. Still the effects were great, Spacey as Lex Luthor was great and it had some very good moments...that plane scene was very memorable...So if you are a Superman fan go see it you will probably enjoy it a lot more than me, I thought it was just okay, nothing super though.",4,4,Aaron1375,"Jun 27, 2006",

1,"Not good, but at least there's the Spiderman 3 trailer!","This movie was terrible! One of the worst films I had ever seen in the theater. To think they could only come up with this movie. Why does the plot go nowhere? We leave the theater in the exact same state we came in.The dialog was horrible…when they talked. The action was boring, and the continuity errors were atrocious.This lacks all the magic that made the first two Superman films. Where is the chemistry? The fun…? The story…? Kevin Spacey was the only good thing in this film, but not even he can save this stinker. Brandon Routh makes a decent Superman, though, his writing was a huge problem. If the film had better dialog and a better understanding of the Superman character then maybe he could have gone from okay to GREAT.I wanted to like this movie and hoped Singer could pull it off, but he has failed.He has successfully become the first director to ruin two franchises in two months.Superman Returns and X-men 3 (by not doing it) It is a shame that they will make sequels to this franchise.

The action sequences were mind-blowing and the CGI was fantastic. The story was strongly built around its characters. Clark Kent/Superman returns to find the love of his life Louis Lane a mother and engaged to a fellow reporter. Lex Luther is still the same "" Rule the World "" villain who ends up finding a world similar to Krypton in Antartica. Over all, Superman's heroic rescues, Jesus-figure and shocking, but not obvious twists make this movie a must see for everybody.

2,Dead in the water,"I guess it's time to confess. I have not seen the previous superman movies. I have never read a comic book in my life. However, I have seen several of the more modern attempts at movies based on comic books, ranging from good (X-men 2, X-Men 3, Sin City) and some great ones (Sin City, Spiderman 2). All were cheesy, but in a stylish way that I could enjoy.I suspected the movie was in trouble when the asteroid that impacts earth is preceded by a loud rumble that shakes the house and trails off into the distance as it passes. Haven't the sound engineers ever heard of a sonic boom that accompanies objects traveling at supersonic speeds? Then there's the real opening action sequence that involves a 777 (the only passenger 777 in the world with one aisle) that falls to earth in the middle of a baseball stadium (out of respect for the international audience, this is the closest reference we get in the entire movie to that third thing that Superman supposedly stands for) and then everybody stand up and cheers, instead of fleeing to the exits. I think that sequence was the most ludicrous action sequence I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few clunkers.I think Spacey is good as Lex, and enjoyed parts of it, but the end was long, drawn out, and choppy. The love-triangle thing between Superman, Lois Lane, and, oh that's another thing: Thy the hell does Lois Lane not seem to know that Superman is Clark Kent? Superman doesn't wear a mask, departs and arrives at the same time in her life, and yet she doesn't make the connection. Dumb chick. Oh, where was I? Yeah, it's serviceable to the story. Oh and who brings their kid along to do cold call reporting? I didn't read Ebert's roast until after I saw the movie, and he pointed out that no one would want to live on the island for the next million years. I would also point out that an island coming out of the ground as fast as that one was would have caused a tidal wave that would have made Dec 24, 2004 look like ripples in a bathtub. Appaently the special effects guys have never heard of Archimedes.One more thing: Superman is just not really that exiting a superhero to me: It's all or nothing with this guy: either he's all-powerful and can do anything. Or he's around Kryptonite and is more or less a regular Joe (or is he, since apparently Superman + Kryptonite can apparently take the longest fall anyone's ever taken, and survive). The fact that this substance is as debilitating to him as it is, doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.I've got more. Piano-throwing do-nothing kid. Point where one minute he's dead, and the next minute he's in critical condition. Whatever. Despised the movie. Save your money.",29,41,michaelgs,"Jun 27, 2006",
,"It's a Bird, It's a Plane..............No, It's Just a Bunch of Hot Air.","Superman (Brandon Routh) returns after a five-year disappearance. It appears our hero was off trying to find out if there really were any remnants or survivors from his home planet. While away Lois Lane (a dark-haired Kate Bosworth) has had a son (Tristan Lake Leabu) with a new love (James Marsden). Meanwhile Routh's absence has meant that Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has gotten out of prison and sustained the resources and backing (girlfriend Parker Posey and an entourage of former prison thugs) to become a world threat once again. Spacey has an elaborate scheme to take crystals from Superman's Fortress of Solitude to create new lands on Earth while simultaneously putting old continents under water. Thus Spacey would rule via real estate and alien technology. And of course that darn kryptonite keeps on popping up thanks to Spacey's past knowledge and advanced planning. ""Superman Returns"" is a huge bore to put it mildly. The film runs way too long (over 150 minutes), the plot is dumb, the characters seem lost in the venture and the direction (by the over-rated Bryan Singer who is still looking for a project to match ""The Usual Suspects"") is totally uninspired and sophomoric. Routh is a total wash as Superman, Bosworth seems out-of-place (to be fair though Margot Kidder was the weakest link in the four earlier films) and the supporters (namely Frank Langella and Eva Marie Saint) make absolutely no impression. Spacey and Posey do everything in their power to salvage the mess, but just cannot overcome the lack of a suitable screenplay and non-existent tone. Really I wanted a film on Lex Luthor rather than Superman because the villains are much more intriguing than the good guys. After 19 years in cinematic dormancy, ""Superman Returns"" ends up doing nothing to get me any more excited about the cinematic concept than I was after ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"". 2.5 out of 5 stars.",5,8,tfrizzell,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,"If you don't get chills, you're not a Superman fan","I have always been a Superman fan, for as long as I can remember. I grew up watching the old black and whites on CBS. I was always amazed at this guy that would burst through brick walls, get shot and not die and flying from here to there in a blink of an eye. Yeah, I was hooked.I saw the original movies when they came out, albeit I was just a young man. I thought Christopher Reeve was amazing. He was Superman in ever way. He sold the part like no other before him. I loved General Zod (Terrence Stamp) and the whole storyline. As I said… I'm a fan. With the other Superman movies, the scale of excellence seemed to slide a little and sure enough, by parts 3 and 4… well… the franchise seemed rather doomed.After the success of Spiderman on the big screen, followed by Spiderman 2, I knew it was only a matter of time before Kal-El would return to the big screen. I couldn't wait. Then came the rumors…. ah yes… Nick Cage as the favorite son of Krypton? Could it be? Please tell me this is a joke. Anyone, please, stop this from happening. Thankfully, it never took place. After several scripts, several directors and a several names mentioned for the part, Bryan Singer came on board.When this happened, not only did I know the story would be in good hands, I knew it'd be done like never before. Bryan worked his magic with Xmen and Xmen 2 and those were incredible as far as comic stories go. I knew the franchise was in good hands. Who will they get to play the part though? Who could possibly make me believe he was Superman as Chris Reeve did? Brandon Routh, a small town boy from the mid west enters the picture. He'd read for McG (earlier director) and Singer liked him so he was kept on. Brandon tried out for Smallville's lead role but lost that to Tom Welling. I myself am a huge Smallville fan, yes, I am a geek, I admit it. Brandon encompasses everything that is right and true about Clark Kent. He IS Clark Kent for crying out loud. He grew up in his own Smallville of sorts, he has the same morals/values and holy snike, does he ever look like a young Reeve. Brandon sells the role alright. I forgot I was watching yet another actor play Superman. Instead, Routh had me believing that he IS Superman.Watching the movie last night, I was thrilled to see what i saw. I said I wouldn't give anything away, so I won't, but when you see this, if you don't have chills at several parts in the movie… then my friend, you're just not a Superman fan.",1,1,james91,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,"Not as Good as Batman Begins, but Still, A Great Film","Just like what happened with Batman, making another Superman movie didn't sound like a good idea. In fact, I thought resurrecting Superman was even a worse idea because:A) IMO Quest for Peace was worse than Batman and Robin (at least B&R was hilarious) B) WB couldn't get this sequel off the ground for almost 15 years. C) Unlike Christian Bale, the comic book fans weren't very happy about the casting of Brandon Routh as Superman.And while SR isn't as good as Batman Begins (I never expected to be), it's good enough to restart the franchise.The film takes place 5 years after the incidents of Superman II. Superman comes back to earth. Lois (Kate Bosworth) now has a kid (Tristan Leabu) and is engaged to fellow journalist Richard (James Marsden). Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey) is out of prison and as usual, he's got a new plan to destroy Superman and take over the world.Obviously, Superman is nowhere as dark or edgy as Batman, Spiderman, or the X-Men, but that doesn't mean he's living in fairy tale world either. And I think that was the best thing about the script. The Man of Steel got a whole lot to deal with in this film. He's got no home; Krypton has become a ""graveyard"". He's got no love; Lois, the love of his life, is with another man and is mad at him (for leaving without saying goodbye). Luther is still determined to finish him off, and after all, Superman is still an ""alien"" trying to fit in this world. In addition, the script rightfully ignored the horrendous last 2 sequels, and tied nicely with Superman II.But the script also had its fair share of flaws. Luther's plan is somehow silly; I didn't like the direction the story took in the last 30 minutes or so, and I think the kid subplot was pointless.The film had some scenes among the best I've seen this year. Basically, every action sequence gave me huge goose bumps. Director Bryan Singer sure knows how to direct an action scene. The action was well executed, well edited, and had great FX. The love scenes between Supes and Lois were also handled very well. And of course, having John Williams' amazing score playing in the background doesn't hurt either.I was surprised by Routh. I didn't expect much, but he was very good as Superman, emotionally and physically. Bosworth was decent, and Spacey was a blast. He was very funny without losing the character's edge. It must be something about working with Singer because I don't recall Spacey having this much fun since The Usual Suspects. . So, I'd definitely recommend Superman Returns.

8,Pretty Darn Super,"Great return to the ""good"" Superman story line (forget about III & IV!). I liked how it picked up right from the end of II. Brandon Routh was a great choice to play Clark/Superman. He believably exuded the dopiness of Clark and the sheen 'superness' of Superman. Kate Bosworth just didn't do it for me as Lois though. I guess I am just partial to Margot Kidder. GREAT JOB to Bryan Singer, even if it did mean giving up X3 to do this. I wish he somehow could have done both. Brett Ratner just didn't have the right vision in my opinion. BTW, if you can, see Superman Returns on an IMAX screen. IT ROCKS!! Check it out. You won't be disappointed (Don't drink too much.

7,Superman Returns and it's good to have him back,"I just got back from a Wednesday afternoon showing, and have to say I'm relieved. Having seen (and loved) the first two Superman movies, and having suffered through the third and fourth, this should definitely be grouped with the first two. While it's not equal to Donner's classic, it's close in quality to Superman II.The key to this film's success is the characters. The effects are great, the story is acceptable, but the emotion between Superman, Louis, Lex Luthor, and all is what makes the movie. Singer and Routh do a great job of depicting a being who is pretty much invulnerable physically, who could take whatever he wanted if he chose to, but instead suffers his broken heart with quiet dignity.Action sequences are top notch, and epic all the way. The humor is there (I would have liked a bit more), the dialogue is there (it always is in a Brian Singer production - see ""House"" on Fox). The pace was a little off from my perspective - it seemed just a little slow.I recommend Superman Returns. It's not a classic, but it is definitely worthy. I can't wait until the next one. Brainiac?

If they make more i hope they don't fall into the trap they seem to, the one where they change directors. This is the same director who did the first X-Men movies. It has humanity and heart and a good mix of adventure. Its nice also not to have a ""reimaging"" of the idea too.

Brandon Routh truly can claim the Superman role from here on out.

Brandon Routh plays a marvelous Superman and Clark Kent that Christopher Reeve would have been proud of.

If you go into it having read this and somewhat knowing what to expect, I think you'll end up liking it more.PROS: It's really amazing seeing Superman use his powers with modern special FX technology. It's got lots and lots of heart and humor. The cast is pretty solid. Great character piece for Superman. CONS: Unfortunately, there's not a hell of a lot more in the movie than what you see in the trailer. I mean, yes there is more, but it's not like there's some surprise, eye popping 30 minute finale with Supes fighting a squadron of super-enhanced bad guys, like you'd see in those fantastic Justice League cartoons- ripping apart half of Metropolis, knocking each other through buildings or punching so hard that the shock-waves alone cause mass destruction. Also, plot is for the most part secondary to character, and there is at least one major story point I doubt I'd have ever written into a Superman story... ever (not to say that said story point didn't work)! Lastly, the movie is nearly 2 1/2 hours long, and about 3/4 of the way into it you start to feel it, especially as it draws to something more anticlimactically character based than something viscerally crowd pleasing.OVERALL: I wanted to go into Superman Returns expecting a lot, and getting more than I'd hoped- and that didn't really happen- although I did like it a great deal. Outside of the comics and other Superman movies, this is a very well executed piece of work. Those with little patience will probably say the movie is boring. However, SR is so damn likable, humorous, and heartfelt, that it's almost impossible to say you didn't enjoy it. Certain friends would argue ""What? Was it too smart for ya?"", and for many I'm thinking it might be. In the grand scheme it's bold, and perhaps even innovative, to stick to such a personal level of storytelling for a tent-pole summer blockbuster superhero movie, while at the same time I wish they'd pulled a little more of a ""Spider-Man"" and met us closer to the half way mark of being a spectacle. Supes should do great business, but I don't think many will go see it more than once (unless it somehow locks into that 14 year-old teen girl crowd that Titanic nailed). I don't see it quite doing Spidey numbers, but it should reach 200 million with little effort... though Pirates Of The Caribbean opening the following weekend should definitely have an impact.",1,1,garmquessler,"Jun 27, 2006",

10,Bryan Singer ROCKS!!!,"This movie is the reason why Bryan Singer is the new superhero director. The music from the original movies, an outstanding script & a powerhouse cast all made this movie 1 of the best superhero movies ever. GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!! Brandon Routh is incredible & the resemblance to Christopher Reeves is scary. If you are a fan of the Chris Reeves ""Superman"" movies you will not be disappointed. Special effects were flawless. Kevin Spacey played the role of Lex Luthor perfectly. He played the part as a complete psychopath, which just made it more fun. Kate Bosworth as ""Lois Lane"" was so much better than Margot Kidder. Finally we get a sexy Lois. Seeing James Marsden in a Bryan Singer movie without superpowers was a little weird, I kept waiting for the rose crystal shades to come out. This movie is definitely worth the $8, GO SEE IT NOW!!!",1,2,Fearless_Leader,"Jun 27, 2006",
,first-rate effort,"There are moments in this movie, where i was completely spellbound by the beauty of the pictures. Bryan Singer made two X-Men movies before this, learning how to do the Superman film, greatly inspired by the 1978 Donner film. In the end, he has a movie that has evolved to be something more, giant, expansive, compelling. For a lot of reasons I have always loved the character. He hits a bit of a darker note with this film, his virtue is a bit shadier, but in the end, he is still the same. Newcomer Brandon Routh soars with his performance, nuanced at times and he takes the part seriously, effortlessly, perhaps channeling the late Christopher Reeves, Routh is every bit as iconic. The reviews may have been mixed, but I honestly don't know any other way a Superman film could have been made. Except worse. The only real challenge this team had to do was be better than the films III and IV. I believe his flight, his strength. I believed it all.Spacey's Luthor is every bit as funny as Hackman's, but he is somehow more sinister. His crew of henchman are vicious, and I suppose Ned Beatty is thankfully dead somewhere, shivved in a prison shower for his incompetence. Parker Posey, brings an interesting turn to the sidekick role as does Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen.My biggest reservation was the Lois Lane character, but I thought this version was a bit harder, not as flighty as the Margot Kidder reporter. James Marsden also brings a warmth and heroic role as Richard White, her live in boyfriend. There are a lot of themes in this movie, some which the Religious Right may have problems with. Alas, a good film it is.",0,1,thebrainflow,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,I had to stop myself from cheering,"I'm not a superhero fan or a comic book fan, but from the moment that wonderful music started to play, this turned into the perfect summer movie experience. Spacey has great fun as Luther, but is almost upstaged by Posey as his tart-with-a-heart companion. Brandon Routh had me a little worried from the previews, but excels as a man struggling to accept that things have moved on in his absence. The effects were spectacular - the shuttle/jet sequence is simply astonishing. There are those who think that Bryan Singer is a genius, and then there are those who are wrong. Sit back and enjoy...",3,5,kmcnab,"Jun 27, 2006",
8,Superman Returns stays true to the old,"As a huge fan of the old superman movies, I was excited about Superman Returns. Without saying to much about the plot, I would have to say that Superman Returns was a huge achievement for all involved in the work. Kevin Spacey did such a good job as Lex Luthor, that I could hardly tell it wasn't Gene Hackman. Newcomer Branon Routh did a fairly good job as superman as well( He wasn't as good as Christopher Reeves, but he still did a good job). While there was some cheesy comic laughs the movie was all in all a good movie, and a good sequel. The action was amazing, and Superman looked as if he were actually flying. All in all I would give the movie a 8.5, and its definitely worth a see.",1,1,Standinstil,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,We need superman... Yes we do...,"This movie just came in the right time for me.I was thinking for years, why would they not producing a rerun for superman with these new technology. But now I understand better why it had to be wait so far.It is quite as classic as it could be possibly done.Good picture, recommend to everyone...Just watch it with the white curtain before you criticize. If possible watch it with a full audience, and listen the silence in the right moments.One mother was getting his children out, and it was quite interestingly good to see the children crying and hence that the legend is timeless.",3,4,threedeeguru,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,An excellent Movie - like an evening with an old friend,"I saw the Chris Reeves/Richard Donner ""Superman"" on opening night back in 1978. That was a big deal, and it was a wonderful experience giving all of us a chance to see a flesh and blood Son of Krypton. There were things that I loved and there were things that I disliked then, and have grown to detest in the subsequent years. Gene Hackman wasn't the real Lex Luthor. Margot Kidder wasn't the real Lois Lane. Still, we got to see a man fly, and the portions of the film portraying Krypton were very good, and those portraying Smallville were brilliant (particularly Glen Ford).Superman Returns borrowed from all the right parts of the original, and changed everything that I disliked. The special effects were special. As I watched it I thought about Peter Jackson's ""King Kong,"" a film that cost about the same. Kong was a film that I didn't like, partially because I couldn't find a character I believed or cared about. Superman Returns had real people, and didn't take any short cuts on either the character aspect, nor the VFX.It was a move that made the long wait worth it, and it completely erased parts III and IV from the original series. Go see it.",3,4,clay_thompson,"Jun 27, 2006",
2,waste!,"will admit that my tastes in movies are weird.....maybe I expect too much or whatever, but in a big popcorn summer movie, it is all about the action and NOT about the bs SUPERMAN GLARE or the contrived bull that this movie leans on heavily. And, when you see it, WHAT THE HELL IS THE DEAL WITH HIS EYES? The effects were fairly cool. They stumble a bit in the first quarter of the movie, but after that, ya kind of really believe he is strong as an ox and that he can fly. He just doesn't do enough effin' flying! The ""twists"" don't twist and Kevin Spacey is a subtle as a gunshot blast to the brain pan! The Villain is weak!

9,"A Vote for Truth, Justice and the American Way","This was a very ""human"" movie. The characters were believable and the acting was not overly ""dramatic"". Kevin Spacey was an excellent villain. He did not overplay his role...he was just enough of an egomaniac, but one who also showed a tad of fear. His fate at the end was poetic justice. Superman's comment at the end that he will always be there appeals to all of us...sure a tad schmaltzy...but still part of our belief that good will be there when when need it. This is also a movie worth a second look. I saw it with the air conditioning pouring down on me, and I still enjoyed it. There were several children at the movie and I overheard parents explaining certain parts, but it was not overly frightening. I highly recommend Superman Returns...it represents truth, justice and the American Way!",0,4,pacer66,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Absolutely a delight. Very enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this movie. I honestly walked into the theater expecting to be disappointed but that wasn't the case at all. This movie really captured the whole essence of Superman and it really felt like I was a kid again watching the first Superman movie for the first time. The cinematography was incredible. It looked so real, not to the point where you can tell it's all CG. I really loved the actor who played Superman. It gave me the chills because he does look like Christopher Reeve. The only thing I would've liked to have seen more of is a deeper interaction between Superman and Lois Lane. That area was a little lacking but still, the chemistry between Kate Bosworth and Brandon Gouth is good. Overall, I'm very happy with this film. I'm hoping that there will be another Superman movie sometime in the future.",1,1,monikamtt,"Jun 27, 2006",
5,"Maybe someone will make a GREAT Superman film one day, but this isn't it.","I'll make this quick because I hate long worded reviews: Was this movie great? No. Good? I suppose. Would I see it again? Maybe if it was on cable one day and I had nothing better to watch. Perhaps I went in with high expectations because Singer's X-men films were action packed, funny and downright enjoyable.First off let me say that this film relied too heavily on the Donner Superman films. I think its great when films will reference previous incarnations, or even things from the comics (Wolverine's yellow spandex in the first X-Men for example) but with this film enough is enough! Rehashing lines from Superman 1 just to get a laugh out of the audience was the worst! Give the audience more credit and write something original! Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor? Cool, right? No. Why can't anyone show Luthor as he is in the comic, an evil and powerful businessman. Here, as in the Donner films, he is a sad parody of himself. Gene Hackman wasn't a great Luthor and neither is Spacey. Parker Posey-What a waste of her talent as an actress. Brandon Routh- Great job as Superman, stepping out of any shadow cast by Chris Reeve but when he portrayed Clark Kent I wondered if we were watching Brandon Routh as Clark Kent or Brandon Routh doing his best imitation of Chris Reeve as Clark Kent.With that said, there is a ""surprise"" of sorts that is so unbelievably hokey and stupid that as I sat in the theater I actually said out loud ""Give me a break."" Don't hold your breath, you'll be disappointed. Special effects were pretty cool and overall I'd say see the movie, but don't expect anything fantastic.",4,5,buster9,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,WOW Superman is BACK,"Wow! Superman Returns brought excitement and fun to a new level on the big screen. The film brought superior entertainment, even from the opening credits, with the John Williams score and fantastic imagery of Superman's legendary flight from Krypton to Earth.Superman Returns includes the best acting performance of not one, but ALL Superman characters involved. Brandon Routh brought a touch of realism and a relate-ability to Superman and Clark. Kate Bosworth was charming and emotionally touching in her role as Lois. Kevin Spacey was down-right brilliant in his role as Lex Luthor – making it appear that Lex could be a real person! (not one that I would want living in my city).The spectacular quality of film and all the graphics involved made it easy on the eyes, which is not true for many ""Superhero"" movies.After 20 years without Superman on the big screen, Bryan Singer pulled off a flawless hit that is sure to be a legendary film mentioned in the ranks of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"".I can't wait to see it again!",3,4,brrrian40,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,"Thoroughly Satisfying and Engaging - Action, Drama, Romance, and more Action!!","As it pertains to the past films (not the comics), let me just say first that I really enjoyed this new addition to the pantheon. I was really worried about how they'd mess with the characters and the ambiance of the world they inhabited at the time with this update. However, it's obvious that Brian Singer, having learned his lesson from the first two X-Men movies, knew that he could tweak and update but must keep true to the characters that readers and audiences have come to know and love so well over the years . Too bad Ang Lee didn't learn this in time (see The Hulk, rather don't see it) nor did the geniuses who wrote and directed Spawn. Let's not even start on the atrocities that occurred between Batman and Batman Begins.Anyway, they did more than pay homage to Christopher Reeves' stint in the suit. This was evident in the way Brandon Routh (more on him later) portrayal, the classic beginning credits with the blue laser block letters, the manicured hair with the little curly ""S"" of the forelock, and even Superman's frowning on Lois' smoking. In addition to this, they used a couple of themes written by John Williams for the original movies which really locked in the sense of nostalgia and renewal.It has been a while since I got the chills, goose bumps, or a lump in my throat at the start of a film. The last time it happened was when The Phantom Menace came out and I sat there, enthralled and enraptured at seeing, first, the green Lucasfilm logo, then the Fox drum roll fanfare, and finally, the blue text scrolling upward, disappearing into an apex. Of course, after the dreck that followed, George never gave me the goose bumps again.However, this time, as I sat there and heard the first few strains of John Williams' Superman Theme (the driving staccato of the strings and then the horns beaming triumphantly in unison), I got those chills and goose bumps! I was so excited that I started clapping my hands like a little girl who was getting exactly what she wanted under the Christmas tree. I felt silly doing it but I didn't care. Happy happy, joy joy.Now, the rest of the movie deals with Superman's return after going off to ""find himself"" for 5 years and the aftermath of his absence. I'll let you read the summaries elsewhere but he goes on to do the super stuff we expect from him. Though, I have to say, even though I knew he would come through and pull off some incredible feats, my palms were sweaty during the scenes without my even being aware. The action sequences were well done and, with the technology and graphics of today, Supes was given a much needed update on the exhibition and extent of his power and abilities. Another nice touch is Superman's struggle with the idea of being the only one left of his kind and the loneliness that ensues. There was a nice bridge made from Jor-El, to him, and on. Very touching.Brandon Routh, whom I'd never heard of until this movie, does a fine job of oscillating between geeky Clark (love geeky Clark!) and the Man of Steel. Somehow, he has managed to channel Christopher Reeves' tone and mannerisms to a tee. As I was watching, I didn't think of it as mimicking, rather I just saw it as a continuation of the character from before, which was terrific. Ir was new but comforable! I think he did great justice to the character. Some say his performance is a bit wooden, but the character is not human and doesn't deal with the same things in the same way humans do so I never expected him to break down and lose it or express happiness in a typical fashion. Some of his best acting occurs in the silence as he tries to grapple with his emotions and the expectation to always act accordingly. You be the judge.Kate Bosworth seemed a little miscast, though her performance was passable. Donning brown hair (badly permed, mind you), she did her best to bring brassiness and smarts to her usually cutesy frame. All in all, she was all ""just okay"" but they certainly could have cast someone who didn't have to try so hard at being the savvy, world-weary type. I'm not sure about the chemistry between her and Routh but I'll make sure to be more aware of it the next time around. On a side note, now that she's a mom, couldn't Lois have a nice, womanly body instead of that of a 90 lbs. 14 year old? Kevin Spacey phones in his role as Lex Luthor, the villain. I still believe he's one of the great actors of our time but he seemed to just coast through this role, though he a moment or two. Maybe it was just that easy for him. Parker Posey as his girl Friday, was engaging and interesting, and she continues to be an under rated actress Overall, this is a movie I will see over and over again. I thought it dealt very well with social and personal issues...such things even a super hero has to struggle with. Kudos to Brian Singer and the cast! Brandon Routh...you've surmounted all expectation and comparison. This is your role now and you deserve it!",1,1,jenchough,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,"The ""Real"" Superman is Back!","I remember going to see ""Superman: The Move"" 28 years ago on its opening weekend. For weeks the advertising had said, ""you will believe a man can fly"". He did. And it did.I've always been a fan of Superman - I'm 48 and started with the comics 43 years ago after seeing reruns of the George Reeve TV series - and for nearly 3 decades I've waited for someone to make a movie that lived up to that first Richard Donner film. Bryan Singer has not only stepped up to the challenge, he has both embraced it and polished it to make the Man of Steel more luminous than ever. No doubt you have read that Singer wanted to stay faithful to the Donner film by making a sequel rather than a remake. Five stars right there. Singer even goes so far as to incorporate many elements of the first film into his own without appearing to force them in for familiarity's sake. All the visual and verbal references - including Marlon Brando's soliloquy, dialog between Superman and Lois, and the styling of the scenery - fit naturally. (There is even a sly visual reminder of the fate of the poor detective who trailed Otis in the subway tunnel.) That's 2 more stars. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor! Who else? Two more stars. And Brandon Routh is somehow channeling Christopher Reeve while still managing to make the role his own with a quiet, confident performance that says this guy has enough talent not to get typecast. Final two stars.So how did I go from eleven stars to ten stars? Not her fault, but Kate Bosworth just doesn't convince me she is Lois Lane. Her performance is quite good, but her age, youth and overall style just don't fit the image of Lois. There is the one star deduction. Not a biggie and it's the worst that can be said about this otherwise remarkable film.The original film presented Superman as a gift to humanity from a dying planet. This film opens with Superman having been absent from Earth for five years and the uncertain claim that Superman is no longer needed. When you see this film, you will not only believe a man can fly, but you will no doubt leave the theater wishing there really was a Man of Steel. The world could really use a Superman!",3,4,jgwingfield,"Jun 27, 2006",
4,"Superman fans, stick with the original.","To Bryan Singer and the writers of Superman Returns, next time be original. This is nothing more than a knockoff of the original Superman movie from the opening title sequence to Superman's flying past the camera at the end. At least 25% of Superman's lines are verbatim from the original movie. There was no originality to Brandon Routh's Clark Kent or Superman; he was just a cheap imitation of Christopher Reeves. In addition, this story was boring, at times incoherent and frequently left a lot to be desired. Kevin Spacey is the only thing worth seeing this movie for. He played the mad villain superbly. If you are a fan off the original 2 movies, stick with them.",3,4,spidermanchemist,"Jun 27, 2006",
3,I wish Kryptonite kept me away from the theater!,"This film was esthetically pleasing and well acted, but about an hour too long. The story was really drawn out for no apparent reason. I am going to have to go against critic opinion and give it three stars at best…just know that at heart this is a love story not an action film. Even though one must leave expectation behind and keep an open mind...I feel the film just failed to connect with the audience. Everyone walking out of the theater was mumbling the same sentiments. The film has substance but wasn't pieced together correctly to convey the story. By the way, as it's PG-13 rating suggests, this film is not for young children, not because of any violence, but because no young child could possibly sit through this 2 1/2 hour film and neither could some adults.

10,A perfect super-hero film,"It was a rainy evening in south Detroit when a friend and I strolled into the local theater to see Superman Returns. My day had been alright: work, dinner, and a hopefully a good movie to close it all off. I paid my $7.50, grabbed a soda, and settled into a comfy chair amid a hundred more of its like inside a cool movie theater. I chatted and poked fun at the previews for the summer's upcoming films as a strange air of anticipation grew for the latest Man of Steel rendition. From the moment the opening credits rolled supported by the classic Superman score I knew this film was something special. From the first scene through to the last Superman Returns was exciting, gripping, humorous, and cinematically astute. From the ride away from the theater to my walk to the bedroom all I could think about was Superman and its wonderful blend of the classic coupled with new, innovative film styles and effects.

10,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!","Well everyone, guess what, Superman is back! And he's here to stay. I'm telling you, this film is absolutely amazing, and is exactly what the definition of summer blockbuster is. Director Bryan Singer, who made ""X-Men 1 and 2"", does the Superman franchise a great service by bringing the man of steel back into our movie-going lives. Props to you Bryan! ""Superman Returns"" is basically a continuation of the original Superman films. Superman aka Clark Kent goes away for five years trying to see if his planet of origin, Krypton, still exists. After he returns he finds everything turned upside down. His old nemesis Lex Luthor has concocted up another evil plan for power, and Clark's old flame Lois Lane has gone and married someone else, as well as writing a story called, ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"". It's up to him to save the world once more.Now it is time for me to go on and on about how super this movie is. Where to start? Newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman is great; he is like Christopher Reeve reborn. And Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor added an evil quality to the character while still being funny, while Gene Hackman from the originals was just funny and not evil. My favorite character though, was Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen who was absolutely hilarious in every scene he's in. His career will definitely skyrocket as will Brandon Rouths'. Another thing I loved are the opening credits, as the camera travels through space and witnesses the jaw dropping demise of Krypton. That brings me to the visual effects, to which I will say, ""Wow"". Need I say more? The music by John Ottman reinvents John Williams original score but at the same time staying true. It is beautiful.There was one thing that really bugged me though, there was a crackling noise coming from the screen the ENTIRE movie that annoyed me to no end. That happened with ""Poseidon"" too! We pay $8.00 and then are shown an amazing movie on a crappy screen. I will rejoice the day the theaters in Saginaw switch over to digital. Oh please be soon.Now it is time you get up and go to the theater to see this destined classic. And after the filmmakers spent 200 million dollars on this film, they're going to need lots of theatergoers.I give it a whopping 10 out of 10!

This was the first movie that I've watched since I was a kid that gave me tingles. Every time Clark Kent would strap on the cape, the tingles would be with me the whole time!

Maybe I grew up watching to much of the original- or the cartoons spoiled it for me on TV, but I didn't enjoy the film. In my mind, the perfect Lex Luther is calm, cool, and a dispassionate bad guy- the ultimate undefeatable super villain. In the movie he is a angry, childlike, whiny, bad-line spurting B villain. Now, one just can't blame Kevin Spacey (Ill always love American Beauty forever!) but he was the wrong choice. He wasn't.. Lex Luther. The other problem I had was Routh. Now, maybe he is young (this being the only movie I had ever seen him in) but Christopher Reeves would have wept! I mean, yes, he was beautiful (and my god, he beautiful) but he didn't have a superman quality. Actually, in my mind, he was more beautiful then Kate Brosworth (who didn't do a bad job herself). But a wonderful face and large, broad shoulders don't make the Superman-- the acting does.

1,Pedestrian retread of 70's flick,"'Supes Returns' is a re-tread of the first movie's plot - the only thing new is the romantic sub-plot, which is a good one, but that's it. There was zero dramatic tension; in other words, we were simply watching it all unfold. And there was zero Wow. For 270 mil I expect some Wow, and I saw it in 3-D IMAX! Note on that: the middle-field of the 3-D was often under-sized, which made things like trucks look like toys. And a really large mistake was not establishing how super this man was. Routh is shown in his big Clark-suit then the first time we see him as Superman, it's CGI! It seemed like those Fleisher cartoons, after all, and every time his muscles were too-bulging. Upon seeing Routh again after that in the costume, my thoughts were, is this another one of those padded costumes? -- which is the man, which the effects?The powers: where were they? Nearly everything was catching, throwing, and flying, as if the film's reduplification of ""iconic"" 30's comics covers is supposed to make us feel all exited in and of itself. The X-Ray Vision and Super-Breath were thrown away on unimaginative uses and the Heat Vision came out once in an only mildly interesting manner. So, we were subjected to rising heroic fanfares frustratingly accompanying very pedestrian action and effects. The first 45 minutes ground forward establishing canon with overly-painstaking effort and over-long scenes. omg and what brainiacs voted to retain the original's ""lighthearted"" 70's cutesy-humor? ...the very aspect that prevents the original from playing well to a modern audience!The other theater-goers in our showing seem to have agreed. Here we were, opening-day IMAX Supes-geeks with shirts n stuff, and after the film there was only scattered 'pity-applause'!I'm here to announce the actor chosen to bear the S-Shield has zero charisma. That's about all there is to say about it.And this was not any person's idea of Lois Lane. Jeez. No spine. No snark. No brains...what's up? Unlike some younger actors, Bosworth seems unable to play older or savvy. Not only do I have no interest in seeing this again, I wish I hadn't gone through the unpleasant experience.",37,51,timoburke,"Jun 27, 2006",
8,"Super-flashy, Super-entertaining, Super-lacking?","Let me get this out of the way first - I am a huge Superman fanboy. One of my fondest childhood memories is watching the original Chris Reeve Superman with my family as a child and being awestruck in the scene where he catches the helicopter. The opening credits still give me goosebumps.Now, saying that, I will agree that this is an excellent movie. Its very entertaining, the characters are well developed and the FX are second to none. In short, I have no gripes with the movie. The references to the previous movies in character interactions and scenes filmed in the same style as the original Superman (practically take from the first and redone with Brandon Routh) added that final polish that most films lack. I was particularly impressed by Kate Bosworth's portrayal of Lois Lane - just the right amounts of anger, frustration, desire and hope all mixed into one. After the annoying performance by Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, one could imagine LL falling into the same pitfall. But, and this is testament to the writer's skill, you never hate Lois Lane. If anything, you feel for her, and how she's torn by the return of Superman.However, I have one criticism - no one really says anything. With the exception of Lex Luthor (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Spacey), no one else says a whole lot. You do get a lot of emotion from the way the scenes are done, but there's something missing. Its really a minor flaw in an otherwise entertaining movie, but at times you're left wondering why you're rooting for Superman. However, I'm looking forward to a sequel - I have faith in Bryan Singer as a director.Superman has returned to the big screen. Congratulations guys, you did an amazing job.",1,1,iamnotafish,"Jun 27, 2006",
5,Superman never left,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining and fun. It is sadly not a great Superman movie. I wish that everyone who sees this film enjoys it and feels that they saw something worthwhile. I say this because it seems clear that the production worked very hard to achieve a great Superman movie and it is a good movie.Superheroes are not an easy chore and I think the production of Superman Returns did a grand job of bringing this guy back and yet it misses more from its ties to what happened before then what is presented as new. I walked out last night feeling that I had seen a good movie, but once again knowing that this material was not in the best of hands.It was a good effort.",1,1,Sabre77,"Jun 27, 2006",
3,I can't believe people thought this was a good movie.,"First of all, those 3 points are for the effects. The acting? Amateurish. Parker Posey crying scenes? Don't make me laugh.And if you're going to have a love story subplot, make it at least lukewarm. Those two actors had absolutely no chemistry.As with most movies these days: NO CHAR. DEVELOPMENT! A previous poster stated that one did not feel for any of the characters. I felt the exact same way. Brandon played Superman like a robot in his dialogue...always seemed subdued. Granted his Clark persona was pretty good.There was no buildup, no suspense, and yes, even though it's a fantasy, let's stick to some of the obvious limitations of Superman from the comicbooks.Kryptonite is deadly to him, yet after being exposed to it, getting the crap beat out of him, and then a large blade of kryptonite stuck in his side, he still manages to tread water to be saved by his friends? Oh yeah, and then he takes the whole mini continent that is loaded with kryptonite, lifts it and casts it into space. According to my comic books, Superman just near kryptonite suddenly becomes weak. Please.Too many inconsistencies, gaps, the movie does not flow. Come on folks, let's keep the standards high, so these bloated producers stay on their toes and give us what we want...a well-made film.",19,19,mwsully68,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,better than the high expectations,"This movie had all of the action/adventure that you'd expect from Superman, with none of the corny script-writing that we've come to expect and tolerate from Hollywood. They managed to avoid some expected cheezy conversations and as a bonus added in a lot of humor. Casting was perfect. Special effects were excellent without being over the top. Storyline was classic and unforgettable. This movie immediately makes my personal top 10 list and is nestled somewhere in between Usual Suspects and Star Wars. Bryan Singer is also nestled in between Johnny Depp and Kevin Spacey on my list of ""I'll go see anything with his name on it."" When does the sequel come out????",1,2,aprilsworking,"Jun 27, 2006",
8,Continues in the original spirit of Donner's while holding its own,"After a decade of false starts ranging from reboots to re-imaginings of the franchise, a new Superman movie has finally reached theaters; Superman has returned.The film certainly has its faults, as do all films that carry so much hype and emotion for those stepping through the door. The icon of Superman has become an American symbol and a legacy throughout the country and elicits its fair share of childhood nostalgia. So how does Bryan Singer's version hold up to past incarnations? Quite well. Built as a semi-sequel to the first and arguably the second of the original Superman films from the 70's and 80's, Superman Returns continues not only the stories of our favorite blue boy scout (Brandon Routh), the overzealous female reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the young funny guy photographer Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), Daily Planet Editor in Chief Perry White (Frank Langella), and bald super-baddie Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), but the film also adds on to certain themes from Richard Donner's original 1978 film, such as the idea of passing on the family heritage from father to son, the ideas of adoption, of loneliness, of obligation to a greater good and more central, the idea of Superman as a savior to mankind. While Singer and his writers add to this legacy, they also map out their own, deepening the Lois/Superman relationship and adding some unsuspected twists and turns into the mythos.Overall, Returns has some problems - perhaps a bit too lengthy a running length for the average movie-goer, and some pacing issues in the beginning and end, but overall, the rebirth of this franchise was worth the wait. Great FX, great action, heartfelt moments. They hit all the right points out of the park, and the rest is more than forgivable. The beginning credits alone which hearken back to the original films was enough to give goosebumps. Superman's Back.",3,3,popehowardtheduck,"Jun 27, 2006",

He is definitely a great actor and playing the man of steel is surly gonna make him a big star. I look for great things ahead of him in his future.Overall, HIGHLY Recommended!!!

7,Superman returns to his old glory?,"The film opens slowly as it explains the five year absence of Superman. Clark returns to his old job only to find Lois is engaged to Richard with whom she has a child. Then as soon as Lois gets into trouble Bryan Singer does what he does best, creates a thrilling visual experience. Once the effects in the film start they continue on throughout the film with very few visible flicks of the digital wand. The movie is engaging and put together as well as any other recent comic movies, But was a superman plot ever all that suspenseful, thrilling, or relatable? This movie like the previous Superman movies suffers from the writing restraints it character creates. THE man of steel does two things in this movie... Casually save the day with only a small smirk, or become a worthless mess the moment kryptonite comes into play. This causes the movie to lack the tension of a Spiderman or batman script; sure we know they aren't going to die either but at least they bleed. But putting aside previous complaint the movie is worth 9.50. It is well written (baby mama drama) and seamlessly integrates stunning effects.",0,1,eloc_86,"Jun 27, 2006",

10,Superman returns in full force,"To be honest I was never truly a Superman fan; I was only interested in the mythos of the hero. Having known the general back story of Superman from what I knew from comic book encyclopedias, ""Smallville"", the first two movies, some of the comics themselves, and of course Wikipedia, I was looking forward to this film. Bryan Singer managed to pull off the X-men movies, revamping that comic books could become very good Hollywood materials, and he's proved that again with Superman Returns.The story, as many would know, takes place five years after Superman II. Our hero has returned from his journey to the remains of Krypton, and is greeted with much applause and excitement from the world. Well, except for Lois Lane. Returning back to the world as well is Lex Luthor, released from prison after the events of the previous film (the latter films, I suppose, are now excluded from the Superman movie canon?). He now has a new plan to overtake the world by force as well as eliminate Superman as well. After walking into the abandoned Fortress of Solitude, Lex gets a hold of a bunch of crystals that will grow into massive landmasses by imitating minerals that they are exposed to. Using water as a catalyst, the land masses would grow into full continents, wiping out, as Lex exclaims, ""BILLIONS!"" The film's visuals are compelling, now giving, for one, Superman's flight such an amazing sense of depth and realism. The first action sequence of the film, which involves our intrepid hero stopping a free-falling plane that had been attached to a malfunctioning rocket that was being launched into space (that's a mouthful) is just so spectacular. Yet when I saw and compared the flying sequences of this film to the previous ones, I realized just how well done the predecessors had done in terms of visuals. This is a film that has been long since coming, and I'm glad that Warner Bros. finally chose upon Bryan Singer. The last two Superman films, though not nearly as disastrous as Batman and Robin, did almost stain their protagonist's image in the mythos, however what Singer does here, knowing that the self-kidding hero had been pushed a little too much, makes this one a more serious, more toned story, just as Batman Begins does with its hero. What we now have is a superhero that returns to a world that, after his long absence, has become almost worse than it had been when he left it. Along with that, he now faces the challenges of being rejected by the one person he cared for the most out of all the world, Lois Lane. She has a fiancée and a son, but still remains deeply hurt by Superman's departure. As well, Lex Luthor is, as I said, more vicious and cunning as before, and there is a sequence in the film where his cruelty is unexpected but effective. I really liked Spacey's performance. He has a lot of sinister smiles in this film along with his dialogue, and it was great to see that familiar smile that we see in a lot of his villainous roles. Brandon Routh, a relative unknown, looks remarkably like his predecessor, the late Christopher Reeve. At first I was not sure about his effectiveness in continuing the role, however this film has confirmed that he was the perfect choice. With Clark Kent Routh plays him down, just as Reeves had, and perfectly portray's Kent's tendencies to say the wrong things at the wrong time, shy, and of course, try so hard to ""hide"" his feelings for Lois Lane. Bosworth's performance as Lane was wonderful, and I hope she will be returning in what I hope may be the sequel to this film. This film was long (as well as this comment), however it was so worth the time. What got to me, however, was the way the massive disaster that ensues with Luthor's plan seems to affect only Metropolis. As well, Kent completely vanishes in the latter parts of the film, and I began wondering why everyone was so concerned with Lois Lane if Clark Kent was also missing from work as well. But then again I suppose that was how Superman intended Clark to be-- played down so much that he appears invisible to everyone. But I digress. Superman Returns is everything that I expected it to be. The timing is excellent as well. In a time where the world seems like it may be heading downhill, it's great to see a film that returns the most heroic superhero of the twentieth century back into our minds. Like the people of Metropolis and the world it occupies, Superman is its beacon, and he ""lights the way"". If only that were so in our world.",1,2,WBSlinger63,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,Singer true to the Superman character of all ages,"As he has demonstrated with his past films, Singer stays true to the Superman character of all ages while appearing to the mass audience of today. Building his main characters steadily, Singer makes us care about what happens to his protagonist and supporting cast. Mixing in humor and a twisting, turning love story, Singer's film is well rounded with few awkward moments, and a beautiful meld with computer generated effects.The comic aficionado will enjoy the special homage to the 1920s pages with frame shots. The honor and sentiment towards Christopher Reeve and John Williams is felt throughout. Routh wins us over with his tenderly believable performance, and his stoic strength is palpable. Spacey is a convincing Luthor with punchy lines and unmistakable intent. Brando's clips bear more and more weight as the story plays out, and remain echoing in the mind.I grew up a Superman fan having never seen any movies in any theatres. This movie displays the quintessential superhero of all time in a world not unlike ours today that needs a motivating figure to look up to. Even if you are not a Superman die-hard fan, you will appreciate the deeper threads that run through the movie.Thank you for such an exhilarating ride.",1,2,CKent007,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,"Great movie, it is worth the watch! (spoiler free)","Greetings fellow movie lovers. I just got back from seeing Superman Returns on this the night of it's opening, and I would have to say the experience was excellent as well as noteworthy. Once again I will add that there will be no spoilers here(only what you could get from previews or the main summary of the movie). I will also add that this is my first time writing a review of a movie on IMDb, so please bare with me. OK, as I was saying my girlfriend and I attended a showing of superman returns tonight and I would rate this movie very high. The effects, the acting, the cinematography, everything was done very well in this movie. In the movie, as you know we enter a modernized world of superman, and yet the film takes place from a point already into the saga, unlike batman begins(however this is definitely it's own movie). Bryan Singer has come into his own and has done a great job on this movie. Though I stated that it is it's own movie Singer's decisions in the movie show how much he appreciates and loves the older movies and superman epic, like his use of the original music and than some. There are signs everywhere in the film that reference the Christopher reeve era films. Though it is impossible to totally make some aspects of superman ""uncheesy"" Singer does a nice job of the real world feel. The movie is longer which is a plus since no movie of this type should ever feel rushed, although there were choice parts that I thought could be longer, but not many. Brandon Routh is a perfect new superman. He is able to make the part his own and yet you do see some reeve present. Kevin Spacey takes Lex Luthor from being a funny businessman who is sort of evil to being an intelligent tyrant out for revenge and personal gain...This film is definitely darker. Kate Bosworth, Sam Hungington, and the rest of the cast all do a great job. In fact there is really only one part of the plot that I thought was a tad unnecessary, or at least shouldn't have been done. Lets see if you all can figure out which part I meant. However it wasn't that bad, and the movie still flows well. Some more explanation on certain parts could be the only other flaw, but all in all this movie is worth seeing and hopefully not just the fans will fall in love with this modern epic. I hope this helped...Thanks!",2,2,guitarwiz21,"Jun 27, 2006",

9,Fabulous!,"I went into this theater expecting a fabulous, exciting movie, and I walked out utterly pleased. It was higher than my expectations! This movie was funny, it got you involved emotionally, it had enough action, amazing special-effects, and excellent acting.Brandon Routh was excellent as Superman, and as the adorably dorky Clark Kent. He has the looks, the muscle, and he doesn't look ridiculous in the blue and red suit. Kate Bosworth was lovely and vivacious as Lois Lane, and James Marsden was, well, so very normal compared to Superman, but he did a good job, too.Whatsisname was a good villain, a good Lex Luthor. He didn't overact the evilness; he got it just right. He got the power-hungry sense, and the wit and intelligence that Lex Luthor has; he didn't overdo it, but nor did he underplay it. He makes the viewers understand why this man has been doing so many horrible things.The only reason I give this 9 is because of the inconclusive ending. I hope that there are more Superman movies with Brandon Routh after this. Bryan Singer did a fabulous job with this.The plot line never lagged. It was always exciting and making the viewer ask questions. It was action packed and suspenseful; it didn't have too much action, nor too much non-action. It had a good balance of emotional conflict and action-type conflict.Also, this movie does not confuse the non-Supermanbuffs. I am not a Superman buff, but I was able to follow what was happening, and what Krypton was and why Superman left in the first place, etc. etc.I would advise this movie to anyone who is searching for a good reason to go to the theater, or for someone who wants to see a good action film, or for people who are wondering if Routh can be a good Superman.

Brian Singer had the chance to make something great and he failed miserably.

9,"At A Time When The World Needs a Hero Most, Superman Returns...and Delivers!","Superman Returns essentially discards the events that transpired in the 3rd and fourth movies starring Christopher Reeve. To most fans, the first two in the series are the only ones that ""count."" Well, Superman fans, be prepared to add another to that list. Superman Returns is a modernized sequel to Superman 2, and it puts the series right back on track with excellent casting choices, a well-developed plot, and plenty of action that you'll see only in a movie starring the Man of Steel.The movie starts out just as the first one did. The Superman theme sounds as the credits roll exactly the way they did in the originals, with the camera going through space from the planet Krypton to Earth. It doesn't take long for Superman to...well, return. A brief flashback of a young Clark Kent sprinting and jumping through a field gives any newcomer the basic rundown of his childhood as he develops his powers over time. Clark Kent, played by Brandon Routh, gets his job at the Daily Planet after a five-year hiatus, and soon discovers that the world has moved on without him. Lois Lane has won a Pulitzer Prize for an article titled ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman."" He also quickly discovers that Lois has a child, and is engaged to the newspaper chief's nephew (James Mardsen, X-Men). Just as Kent rejoins the newspaper, sure enough, Lois Lane's (Kate Bosworth) life is on the line. Superman makes his grand re-emergence as he takes a plane spiraling out of control and lands it in the middle of a packed ballpark. The world is glad to have Superman back, but what caused this catastrophe to happen? Lex Luthor, excellently played by Kevin Spacey, is the answer. Prior to Superman's return, Luthor plunders Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steals the entire collection of crystals Jor-El, Superman's biological father (Marlon Brando) sent with him on his voyage to Earth. The madman later reveals that these crystals are a key component to his plan to create a brand new continent, which, in turn, would send much of mainland America into the sea. In an attempt to keep Superman at bay, Luthor also steals Kryptonite from a museum and sends it into the sea with the crystal, lacing the entire landmass with Kryptonite. Luthor's female counterpart, Kitty Kowalski, is played by Parker Posey, and serves as a comic relief to the more darkened, less jester Luthor.The action is greater than any Superman movie ever. The awkward-looking flights are in the past, and in this film, Superman actually flies. Wind actually hits Superman, as opposed to Christopher Reeve just floating around, meeting no resistance at all. The special effects are amazing, and the scene that got the most ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" at the showing I attended was when a thief pulled out a handgun and shot Superman from point blank, only to see the bullet get crushed like a tin can upon contact with his eye.Some may criticize Kate Bosworth for turning Lois Lane into a damsel in distress, but in this movie, I think it fits. She has attempted to get over Superman by putting her attention on an anti-Superman article, she has become engaged to another man, she has a child to attend to, but when he re-enters her life, she does not know what to do. She truly is a damsel in distress. She loves Richard, but at the same time, she has loved Superman for years. She tries to juggle what is right and what is wrong, and in the end does not know what she should do.Brandon Routh has Superman down. He has the swagger, he has the looks, he has the manliness. The only flaw I saw was his adaptation of Clark Kent. When Reeve played the part, there was a huge difference between Clark Kent and Superman. In this film, Routh's Kent is simply Superman with glasses and a different hair style. Reeve had the small things down to make them two completely different characters. Sure, Routh's speech patterns changed slightly, and his voice pitch went a little higher, but it wasn't enough to distinguish between the two.Kevin Spacey was the best cast of the group, in my opinion. Many critics did not like the fact that in the original movies, Lex Luthor was mainly comic relief, and less of a villain. In this film, Luthor still shows he has about 100 more IQ points than anyone else in the room with his short quips, but he also shows a much darker side than the Lex Luthor portrayed by Gene Hackman. He did an excellent job, and Parker Posey just added to his stellar performance like a sidekick should.All in all, this is one of the best superhero movies I've seen, by far. Nostalgia was a factor in my liking of the movie, but Bryan Singer has resurrected this seemingly-dead movie franchise.",0,1,kgthdc2468,"Jun 27, 2006",

He cast great actors who carried themselves well throughout the whole movie. Young Brandon Routh was amazing, donning the S and carrying that mantle we all love so well. From start to finish, this movie deserves 4 stars. Each moment and scene was so powerful because of the actors, story and direction. I loved it.

Routh's Superman is perfect. Brandon is strikingly similar, physically, to Reeve - but at the same time has added a personal ""warmth and glow"" to the role. The script is strong, and enables the use of a plethora of effects, creating a visual package of award winning proportions. This is fantasy entertainment at its very best.

10,Welcome Back Superman!!!!!!!!!-,"Comic book movies are pretty much the standard in the film industry. There are so many comic books being crossed over to film that it is hard to keep count. And since Spiderman, the genre has made a huge comeback, with the Spiderman franchise, the X-Men franchise and Batman Begins, Superman Returns almost seems like too little too late. I don't think so. Superman started the trend back in 1978 with the release of Superman: The Movie. It was followed up with three sequels and a spin off called Supergirl. Superman IV:The Quest For Peace seems like ages ago though, probably because it has been over 20 years since Superman flew across the movie screen. The fan base has been ready for a new Superman film and they have been rewarded.Superman Returns is an outstanding comic book movie with a great story and deep characters. Brandon Routh is actually very good in this film to the point where you almost forget that Christopher Reeves and Brandon Routh are two different people. But as similar as they are, they are also two very different characters. Christopher Reeves played Clark and Superman as two complete opposites, Clark very goofy and clumsy and Superman as a serious caring guy. Christopher Reeves was known to have been very serious about not letting one character show in the other. Routh plays Clark as just your everyday small town innocent guy who lacks some confidence and Superman as someone who like most people, would love to have that life with a family. You can see Superman in Clark and Clark in Superman and for the first time, we get a first person point of view of what Superman must go through every waking moment of his life.Superman Returns is in someways and indirect sequel to Superman: The Movie and Superman II and as it is faithful to those two films, it also does well in creating a new identity for the series where the film can stand on it's own. In this film, Superman has been gone for five years, on an expedition to where Krypton once was to see if there are any survivors. When he returns, he sees that the world has moved on without him. Superman/Clark Kent is not ready for this change.To watch this film, one does not need to know the history of Superman's origin as it is explained in the first moments of the movie. It hopes that the viewer has seen the previous films but knowing that some of the viewers may be too young to have seen those films, it gives a brief history of Superman's past. With the hit WB show ""Smallville"" still on the air, there is no need for a long explanation. We get pushed right into the story which is great.Kate Bosworth is Lois Lane, the hard nosed reporter who even though she has a child and is engaged, still has her eyes on the man of steel. But like everyone else, she wants her answers as to why he has left. Bosworth plays Lois Lane with a bit of vulnerability. Though she has her family life she is still vulnerable to her feelings towards Superman. Routh and Bosworth seem to have decent chemistry together but I must admit, Reeves and Kidder seemed more believable as a romantic couple.Kevin Spacey is Lex Luthor. This Lex comes off as a cross between Gene Hackman's portrayal and as an older Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor on Smallville.) I enjoyed this combination very much and added much depth to a once two dimensional character. Here is a man who not only wants to be the most powerful man on Earth, but his jealousy of Superman will drive him to do unthinkable things.Though I won't give any more details, I will say that this film does a very good job of keeping up that comic book feel while delivering a new twist to the story.As mentioned earlier, this film does a great job of being faithful to the original movies while creating it's own personality.

10,I do believe a man can fly!,"I read the reviews. It was disheartening to me, who loved the original Superman: The Movie, that Bryan Singer had ruined the film. I sat down in the theater with my Superman Slurpie and my eyes stuck to the screen for 2 1/2 hours. When it was over, I was in awe. Sure, there was corny stuff, and a plot point that I didn't prefer, but the film was so overwhelmingly awesome that those are minor details in the big picture. Starting off with the march, the film doesn't stop for anyone to catch up. The visuals were in itself worth the 9 dollar ticket. IF YOU DO NOT SEE THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN, DO NOT SEE IT AT ALL. This is one of the films you'll want to tell your kids YOU saw it when it was first in theaters, just as my dad did for the original Superman: The Movie. Sure, its not the original, but the thing is when you're watching it, you don't really care. It keeps the camp of the 70's film, but takes it in a more serious direction as the film progresses. Finally, Kevin Spacy is spec-tac-ular as Lex Luthor. I could feel the Gene Hackman vibe with a dash of Spacey's wit and delivery. Superman has returned, and it seems that we really do need him after all. Top 5 movie of the year so far!",3,1,mike31487,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Superman's triumphant return!(Spoiler Free),"I just got back from seeing this movie on opening night in my town. I'll admit, I'm not a terribly big fan of Superman(Like Batman a bit more), but this movie was amazing to say the very LEAST. The effects were amazing, the plot was great, and even though some critics may not like Brandon Routh as Superman, he pulls it off amazingly well in this one. Speaking of acting, Kevin Spacey was especially great as Lex Luthor, and Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. This movie has completely changed my mind about Superman. Overall, it's a fantastic movie that pretty much sums up what a superhero truly is. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie as soon as you can, you won't be disappointed at all.",2,1,Spooky787,"Jun 27, 2006",
9,one of the best action movies i have ever seen,"this movie definitely fulfilled my expectations. some action movies have excessive action that eventually get boring, while other ""action"" movies have barely any, and you walk out feeling like you just flushed $10 right down the crap chute. This movie had a perfect mix of each, and it didn't lean too much on either extreme. Also, most action movies have a crappy screenplay, but Superman was well written, and also very well directed, with many incredible camera angles that are mind blowing, but not too crazy that you get dizzy and sick in your seat. There were also parts where i was expecting one thing and thought i had predicted what would happen, and then boom something happened that i didn't expect at all. the acting was also stellar, and in my opinion perfectly cast. I don't think there could have been a better Clark Kent, expect for maybe Christopher Reeves. Overall, this movie was pretty incredible. I'd see it again, and recommend others to see it as well.",1,1,boyofdestiny99,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Exactly what I was waiting for,"What can I say? Plot: The story went back to the basics. Damsel in distress, Tragic Hero, ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility""-kind-of-stuff. There is obvious references to Christian symbiology, but I didn't think it was played too hard. No ""Nucleur Man"" or what ever it was in Superman IV. Perfect for what it needed.Acting: Probably the best picks for characters. Routh who plays Superman, who I thought would be an ""iffy"" Superman, nailed the part. He really does look a lot like Reeves, but doesn't really imitate him. Still, he is faithful to the character. He definitely showed the difference between Kent and Superman. Probably the one character who I thought was perfect was the actor who played Jimmy Olsen. He serves as a great comic relief, but I wanted to hear more from him. Unfortunately, Cyclops from X-Men is in the movie, and that's all I could think of whenever I saw him.Action: Perfect. Effects were good. Fight scenes were not overplayed at all. I guess it was going to show that a fight with Superman cannot last more than like 5 seconds (it's an exaggeration, the fight scenes were more than 5 seconds). The focus was more on the action that Superman must do to become a hero again. Good all around.Overall: I saw this on the IMAX, so my only problem really was that the 3-D effects sometimes were a little out of focus (and that my friend blew 3 bucks on a soda that costs to refill.) Otherwise, this movie finally shows how good a superhero movie can be. It's a blockbuster guaranteed. I really can't think of a negative for this movie. Plus, it didn't have any stupid hang-ons on the end like X-3 or the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. So, yeah, 10 out of 10 for me. Best movie of the year, to date.",3,1,leprechauner,"Jun 27, 2006",
6,Not bad but not awesome,"I saw this movie last night and I was thinking to myself who is Brandon Routh. The movie starts off very interesting like Superman should start off. I had a problem with Clark's character I thought he wasn't that good but his Superman character was awesome. Kate Bosworth is amazing as Lois, she plays this character in her own way and it works.Lex Luther as Kevin Spacey is Fantastic.This movie was OK it kind of drags on towards the end for a bit but other than that I would recommend seeing it. The movie is not awesome but see it for the action, Kevin Spacey, and the beautiful Kate Bosworth.",2,9,Dmsokana,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Excellent Movie Excellent Cast,One of the best superhero returns movie I have seen. As simple as that. Routh has done an excellent job and lived up to the expectations of superman fans. Kevin spacey suited perfect as lex Luther. I am sure from the story that more superman movies will be evolving which is exciting. I wish someone make a movie on He-Man. Thats one superhero remaining to take a film on. I can't remember how many times in my childhood I wished I could be one of those superheroes. After watching a cartoon on spider-man I don't know how many times I wished that spider bit me instead. LOL. I am sure you can enjoy this movie with your kids if not by yourself. People who say routh is too lean to fit the superman character should watch him. His facial expressions as Clark Kent as well as superman were perfect. Go watch it. Don't miss it.

8,A Great Homage to Donner and Reeve,"When an iconic film is remade you can go two ways - totally go down a different road and destroy what made the previous film iconic - think ""Poseidon"", or you can do what Bryan Singer did and almost duplicate the feel and humanity from the first Superman series of the late 70's early 80's.This isn't just a rehash but Singer tips his hat enough to the Donner directed films to satisfy this old fan and bring enough of current culture to satisfy new fans.It starts with the return of the classic style for the opening credits and liberal amounts of the fantastic John Williams score. I did expect to hear some hip-hop or some bland pop music but luckily that wasn't the case.There are some additions to match where we are currently in pop culture - like having Perry White exclaim that the story isn't the black out but Superman - and the culture of celebrity that seems to infect news gathering today. Jimmy Olsen has a digital camera but he is still scooped by a kid with a cell phone for a picture of Superman.The special effects 30 years ago were cutting edge. The big deal about Superman the Movie back in 1978 was believing a man could fly. With today's CGI, it isn't a big deal. The special effects don't overwhelm the story which is good.In general the actors did a good job.Brandon Routh won the role of Superman in a long process much like Christopher Reeve was chosen back in the 70's. Routh makes the character his own although Reeve was better at the clumsy dork Clark Kent persona.Kate Bosworth did a fine job as Lois Lane. On first blush I thought she was too pretty to play a gritty reporter but in the end she held her own. I did think she was too young.Kevin Spacey oozed evil genius as Lex Luthor just as Gene Hackman did in the 1978 film. Although I did miss Otis - Lex's henchman in the first film, Parker Posey filled in nicely as Spacey's sidekick.James Marsden, Frank Langella, Sam Huntington, Eva Marie Saint round out the main cast. There are also cameos by Jack Larson and Noel Neill from the 1950's Superman TV show. Marlon Brando makes a return as Jor-El which was done by using footage shot for Superman II that wasn't used back in 1980.The plot of the film wasn't spectacular as it was another take on the plot of the first film - Lex Luthor wanting to create land where there is none. The love triangle between Lois, Superman, and Richard White (played by Marsden) doesn't drag the film at all and seems pretty realistic and adds even more to the humanity of Superman. Singer has said the time of this film takes place 5 years after the time of the 2nd film so the relationship is not fake in the least.There is also some funny dialog that helps balance the drama including some obvious double entendres and some plot holes but I think any of the ones I noticed didn't hurt the film at all.A plot twist, late in the film, will at first shock anyone who hasn't read any spoilers - like myself - but does add a new layer to the myth.Some people may have issues with one of the other themes in the film - a religious theme. A bit of Brando dialog used in the TV trailers said: ""Even though you've been raised as a human being you're not one of them. They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you... my only son"" and bit further in the trailer Superman says to Lois: ""You wrote that the world doesn't need a savior, but every day I hear people crying for one."" That dialog is used in the film but the religious symbolism is not a main theme but might still upset some on the religious right.I do hope if there are more films, Singer or future directors add to the story rather than just doing another version of a past plot. It might help to have a different nemesis next time.This is still an excellent addition to the Superman franchise. Welcome back Superman.",3,3,cadfile,"Jun 27, 2006",
7,Unfortunately no Giant Spiders in this one...,"Tonight I saw Superman Returns and had an enjoyable time. I'd give the film *** out of four stars. The problem I had with the film is that I simply am not interested in Superman. I find his character and world boring. That said I think Brian Singer did an excellent job with the film. It is a direct sequel to Superman 2, forgetting that 3 and 4 ever existed. Superman returns to earth 5 years after the events of Superman 2 to find that nothing really has changed, that people have found a way to survive with out him. Lois Lane is engaged to a man, played by the cat who plays Cyclops in the X Men franchise which explains his absence from that film, and with a 5 year old child. Lex Luthor has been released from prison because of a genius loophole in the system where during his appeal they called Superman to testify as a witness but because he was gone they had no evidence to keep him in prison. Things in the world kind of suck for our favorite Kryptonian. Brandon Routh is swell as Clark Kent and exudes an enormous amount of power and grace as Superman. He really filled Christopher Reeves role well. Lois Lane is a lot less edgy this time around but surprisingly this didn't bother me. Kate Bosworth played her closer to the Noel Neil version from the 50's in that she was gentle and sweet. The real highlight in the film is Marlon Brando's scenes which were omitted from the original and were restored for this release. The film had entertaining action scenes, though a few too many, and some real shocks (all I have to say is ""piano"") which brought the film to a fitting dramatic conclusion. Overall it was the best of the Superman films and if you were a fan of the original 2 this one won't disappoint because it stays very true to the spirit of them.",0,1,yo-saff-brig,"Jun 27, 2006",
10,Why the world needs Sumerman...,"Superman Returns is truly an amazing theatrical experience. From the very first scene, I was pinned to my seat. Buy your snacks and go to the bathroom before it starts, because you won't want to miss a second of this one! Just like the X-Men and Spiderman movies, you don't have to know the story before enjoying this movie. All I know before I saw it was that Superman was super in some way and that a character named Lois Lane was somehow involved in the plot. Oh yes, and there's a song called ""Kryptonite"" that seems to reference Superman.What separates this out from the rest of the superhero movies is that this one actually makes you feel good while watching it. Unlike other suspense/action films, this one doesn't make you anxious or uncomfortable...waiting for the plot to just ""move along"" for relief (I would provide examples but I don't want to give spoilers to other movies, but I'm mostly referring to Spiderman). The conflict is for the most part simple and to-the-point, without losing any action or entertainment value. If you're looking for an extremely edge-of-your-seat movie this summer, I suggest you check this out.",2,3,mike677,"Jun 27, 2006",
7,why the world doesn't need superman,"well, superman was a fun movie to watch mainly because of all the special effects. however, certain parts in the film seem too dragged out while other parts seem like they got rushed to finish. the movie is also quite long. what bothered me the most is that the main evil plot / antagonist part of the movie was really lame and feeble. lex luthor is not a strong villain, and his evil scheme isn't that evil. it seems that the movie was 2 hours of watching superman lift heavy stuff and the ending was really anti-climactic. I'm giving the movie a 7 rating only because the acting was pretty good and the special effects were great. the plot was dumb and the movie score was repetitive. Batman begins was awesome, superman returns was not.",0,1,phobophile6-1,"Jun 27, 2006",
6,"Amidst lackluster scripting, profound imagery","Even not being immersed in Superman lore, and having seen the older films long ago, it was still painfully obvious that this continuation from part two goes to great lengths in appeasing the original fan base and emulating all of the aspects that made Superman a household name to all the non-comic book reading viewers out there. By accentuating emotional connections and highlighting visual aesthetics associated with all the romantic notions of being the curled one, director Singer perhaps overshadows any unique spin he could have given the S in favor of paying homage to various historical scenes from previous installments. It is in this revamped homage to past conflict that the actual script looses steam in it's continual repetition. What this plot did in terms of providing something new was merely update previously explored concepts from parts one and two. Acting is cartoonishly acceptable. The much debated Routh integrity seems to fall more to his favor. While the lead lacks the downright charisma to be a versatile leading actor (hasn't stopped the lot of em), he certainly does his best to support the mannerisms and physicality Reeve helped pioneer, particularly on the Kent front. Spacey and Posey have formidable chemistry as the fun duo but really do not walk far past caricature, oddly enough only Bosworth's generically multi-layered performance echoes any actual human sentiment. What does take the cake of this film and purely separates it from sheer mediocrity however is the behind the scenes virtuosity of some of the most intense ""motion"" picturing yet captured. Yes, the flight of Superman far outweighs the plight of Superman, and Singer and crew clearly know this as lavish attention to detail + innovative new camera technology = the best articulation of flight yet captured on film. If anything this movie is worth seeing alone for this analysis into our collective unconscious, given the passionate ode to weightlessness. Matter of fact the poster image shown on this page represents to me the exact moment of the film's most profound relevance, where the shot as Superman lies suspended in space, the curved details in his stilled cape extraordinarily panned, as inner realities submerge into universal implications in any one single breathless moment- that archetypal moment right before a triumph of will that urges us all to harness our own inner super men.",0,1,oneloveall,"Jun 27, 2006",

Needless to say, with no spoilers, Superman Returns offers a super amount of heart as well as action and none overshadows the other.

1,"Superman is 2.5 hours of suspenseless tedium, an uninspired love story, and mediocre graphics","Superman Returns was horrible to say the least. My viewing experience ranged from bored to border. With an invincible main character capable of doing absolutely anything, yet without any semblance of character development or personality, the movie runs a staggering two and a half hours without even slight moments of suspense. One might hope at least to revel in the iconic glory of the (somewhat campy) all American hero, but you are so deluged by clichéd moments with Superman flying heroically in the sun that even that is not satisfying. Even the graphics are not particularly noteworthy, leaving superman constantly looking like a plastic action figure. Superman is about equal parts dull action as it is uninspired love story, and 100% tedious. Beyond being a thoroughly uninteresting movie, I believe this is the first time a movie so unabashedly has Goliath triumph over David. The invincible force of nature heroically defeats small pitiful Lex Luthor who tries to bring the technology of an advanced civilization to man, proving once again the age-old proverb that brawn always beat brains. It seems a very appropriate message when looking at current American affairs, but without a moment of self- reflection the character of Superman and the movie named after him were an epic failure. To its credit I will say that Kevin Spacey was brilliant as always.",20,25,ptraviscraw,"Jun 27, 2006",

10,Why the world should see Superman.,"And..why not see the greatest superhero of all time? Truthfully, there is no reason why anyone should not see this movie.First off, the people who bashed Singer for leaving the X-Men franchise might cool off when they see this masterpiece. Singer's wonderful adaptation of this beloved figure will never be forgotten and will soon pass the great Richard Donner films as 'the' Superman movie(s).(Assuming Singer makes magic again..which in my mind, he will.) The Donner films, although great, still depicted Superman in a 'cheesy' light, and this is one of the edges Singer had over Donner. Singer also gave us wonderful high-def visuals and effects that will 'wow' audiences. But most of all it was his storytelling that was so brilliant. The way he portrayed the triangle of man, as Superman battled between being Superman, Kal-El, and the goofy, yet lovable Clark Kent, was just brilliance. Most of all the other triangle between Lois, Clark, and Superman. And unlike the Donner films, it did not feel cheesy, it felt real, and Singer is to thank for really gripping emotion that was brought to screen.And sorry Brandon Routh. Because you did such a wonderful job as Superman, you will forever be remembered for that roll, and it may be hard for people to depict you anywhere else, bravo. As I recall it was Singer's idea to cast an unknown. Well, bravo. How about Kate Bosworth as a beautiful Lois Lane? Who knew the surfer chick from Blue Crush could act so well? Parker Posey, a comic relief, playing alongside Lex Luthor. And well...the best for last...an absolutely brilliantly mesmerizing performance by Mr. Kevin Spacey. His humor mixed in with brilliance really captured the true villain that is Lex Luthor. By playing true to the comics with the bald head, Spacey truly embodied Lex Luthor and made it his own. Sorry Gene. Also great side rolls in the always funny Jimmy, Lois' fiancé, played by James Mardsen, and the cute little man that almost stole the show.As for the effects and story. Do not worry, it is all there. Whether you are a die hard comic fan, a popcorn movie loving guy, a chick flick gal, or someone who just wants to see a greatly directed movie, Superman Returns is the movie for you.

10,Singer captures The Man of Steel...,"To talk about Superman Returns, I have to talk about the character, Superman...Every culture has a mythos. Every culture has legends and gods. Many good and many bad. Among the countless cultures and the countless legends, every mythos contains one being that seems to stand for the good hidden within the human soul. A being so like us but so different. A being deified for a set of morals that we all hold dear. The embodiment of hope and inspiration. This is Superman. This is the American mythos.I've had my criticisms of Brian Singer. But to capture the character of Superman is a task that earns my respect. Superman Returns strikes the chord at the very heart of what it is to be human and hope, even believe, in something greater than yourself. In a world with murder, rape, and war. It truly takes an unbiased set of morals and principles to be a hero. To do good for the sake of making someone's life better. To think of others before yourself. This is Superman and this is what Brian Singer brought us.I really have nothing bad to say about this film. This is one of the best pieces of American mythos to be committed to celluloid. I hope to see this mythos, that I hold so dear, grow and continue to inspire the generations.Charles Langbridge Morgan once said, ""There are no heroes but in celluloid"", and he couldn't be more wrong. You don't have to be Superman to show selfless courage and take action.

John Williams still did the music, the opening still used the same type of credits, and Kevin Spacey to my surprise was a very good Lex Luthor. Brandon lived up to the best Chris Reeve-like Superman I've seen as of yet, although no one can _be_ him, and it's a hard role to live up to, Lois Lane was not great but she wasn't overpowering and I could handle her--to my surprise she did not ruin the movie for me.

This film will surely be a memory for the next generation of kids to grow with. The plot gets back to the roots of what the comic book genre is all about. The ultimate hero returns after leaving Earth to seek answers to his origins. He finds that his new home is his true home. Superman is the epotime of everything that one could ever want in an idol to save the planet from the forces of evil. Kevin Spacey does justice to the sinister Lex Luther as well.,4,5,wilsonsrt,"Jun 28, 2006",
7,A decent revival of a once great franchise.,"I had the privilege of watching the first two Superman movies on Sunday when they were aired on Space Channel (1978 and 1980). Movies certainly have come a long way since then in areas of special effects, cinematography and er... acting but these early manifestations of the D.C. comic book superhero were still landmark films in their own right. I still enjoy watching the earthquake scene in the first Superman and the scenes of Christopher Reeve flying around saving the denizens of the fictitious Metropolis. Christopher Reeve played Superman with a charming simplicity that never seemed over-the-top. He was a likable bumbling doofus as Clark Kent and the strong yet silent type as the man in blue tights, confident in his abilities but not brash. Margot Kidder's performance as the assertive journalist Lois Lane was also admirable while other performances such as Gene Hackmen's Lex Luthor were well, a little over-dramatic.Enter the cast of Superman Returns. Newcomer Brandon Routh is fantastic as Superman and at times I thought I was looking at Christopher Reeve. His performance definitely plays an ode to Christopher Reeve's portrayal with its simplicity and general likability as both the superhero and his alter-ego. Kevin Spacey plays a more plausible Lex Luthor, albeit with the same comical world domination plans involving the acquisition and marketing of real-estate. Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane seemed somewhat bland and one-dimensional as someone full of spite over the absence of Superman like a girl angry because her boyfriend hasn't called in a week. While this may have been a directorial suggestion I envisioned this role being played more maturely, perhaps by an older actress.Still, this movie is worth seeing. Bryan Singer's adaptation slowly blossoms toward the climax of the film and takes the time to introduce its characters and develop its plot. In the recent revival of superhero movies this time is a godsend, providing more layers and introspective glances at the characters instead of rushing into an action filled series of events. It also allows for some gorgeous visuals of Metropolis (New York City?) and some of the other architecture featured in the film. I expect more Superman movies will follow this one. While it is quite an accomplishment for a revival of a once great franchise let's hope that it goes nowhere else but up.",1,2,blackandwhitekeys,"Jun 28, 2006",

,This movie was a complete disgrace.,"This movie was a complete disgrace to the masterpiece Mario Puzo, Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve created. From the thoughtless underdeveloped and drawn out Lex Luthor scenes, to the RIDICULOUS relationship crisis that basically rips apart the very fiber of the worlds greatest superhero, this movie has left a scar on me of which I may never heal.This movie felt cramped and rushed at the start. Got your hopes up in the middle. And completely crushes any thought of it turning out to be any good in the end.The plot holes and lack of respect for the Superman character as a whole will bring tears to the eyes of anyone who has seen the first two Superman movies. Bryan Singer should get a 10 year ban from being involved in any cinematic endeavors for the attrocity he has created.The only positive factor were the special effects and Brandon Routh as Superman.

He made you watch in awe and feel almost proud. It's visually astonishing. There is not a single thing wrong with this movie. And everyone can and should enjoy it. I'm a comic book fan as well, I could've tore this movie apart I guess but Superman isn't about comic books, it's about a man from Krypton trying to do some good. And Bryan Singer was there with a camera. It's especially good in Imax format, the scenes converted to 3-d are perfect.

Brandon Routh was perfect - there were a couple goosebump moments, like when he did a half smile or a dorky gawk and wave, that made me appreciate the tribute to Christopher Reeve in addition to making me glad that said tribute was not just one long impersonation.The sets were amazing, the action spectacular, and if there had ever been any doubt that Kevin Spacey was the right choice for Lex Luthor, that doubt is now completely groundless. He was brilliant.Lots of edge of your seat moments, plenty of goosebumps (but then again, I'm a comics nerd), awe inspiring landscapes . . . even the kid wasn't annoying! As an action movie, it was perfect. As a retelling that had the potential to go horribly wrong, as an interpretation of one of the most recognized American icons, it was darn close to perfect.",3,4,opiate1138,"Jun 28, 2006",

10,Excellent Movie,"I was 6 years old when the Christopher Reeve movie came out back in the late 70's and I've grown up my entire life with the vision that Mr. Reeve was the face of Superman, when I saw the photos and bit and pieces leading up to ""Superman Returns"", my biggest problem was being able to accept Brandon Routh as Superman. Well...even though I think Mr. Reeve will always be ""Superman"" Mr. Routh did an AMAZING job that made me for almost three hours forget that it was supposed to be Christopher Reeve playing Superman. What a movie! The special effects are great and the flying sequences are of course of the most realistic flying scenes you have ever seen. What I liked the most about the picture was the notable respect they had for the original. The same music from the original Superman even the same music when Lois and Superman are on scene.

9,I've Been Waiting For A Great Movie,"... wait no longer.Well I don't know if I have the words to do this movie justice. First let me say that generally when there is hype around how successful a movie is going to be, I find that I am terribly disappointed once I've seen the flick. There is always something that disappoints me.Thankfully, Superman Returns delivered, and surpassed on my expectations created by all of the hype! The on screen chemistry between Lois and Clarke aka Kate and Brandon, was storybook and fairytale all wrapped up together with a pretty pink bow. The sultry kiss, the longing glances and the painful goodbyes... well you get the picture.Lex Luthor, or Kevin Spacey.... amazing! He is truly cast himself into one hell of a villain. His hencemen could use some work though... why are these guys always baffoons? The debate as to whether Brandon Routh would portray the role of Superman to the level of his great predecessor Christopher Reeve is certainly put to rest. I'll leave it to you to decide for yourself however Wink I thought that the new Superman suit was a bit, cheesy... the old suit seemed more real to me, but I'm a die hard for a guy in shimmery silk.... boxers or a one piece leotard lol I give this movie 8.5 'doggie cannibals' out of 10.http://www.suggestamovie.com",13,10,dumassays,"Jun 28, 2006",

8,good flick .. not worth a 30 year wait,"All in all, the effects and action in Superman Returns were amazing, but few and far between. I prefer an action movie to jump head-first into the eye candy along with a compelling story. But Superman spends a good 40 minutes on back story you've only needed to see the trailer to already be aware of. The majority of the movie focuses on the Lois/Superman love-struggle, which I was never invested in in the first place. I suppose Singer is relying heavily on inheriting much of the pathos generated in the Reeve films. This primary focus causes the film to have few unique characters with little development. I enjoyed the film, but the epic length doesn't match with the basic storyline and two-dimensional characters. You've seen it all before, but through the lens of more primitive film technology. It was not worth the thirty-year wait, and if I never knew who Superman was, it would not be any more exciting of a movie than most DC and Marvel films coming out today.",2,2,xstout81,"Jun 28, 2006",

9,Excellent movie,"Since, everyone else already pretty much said what I feel about this movie let me just say I was very happy with the way the movie was done. Everyone (the actors and directors etc) kept the feel of the original movies while still managing to give some of their own. Routh and Spacey have kept subtle aspects of the Reeve and Hackman in the way they play the characters without imitating them either.As a kid I loved the original movies but after watching them again as an adult I noticed how much most movies at the time ignored certain aspects of physics that made them look rather unbelievable in some scenes. Not anymore, Superman Returns fixes that.The story was well done, lots of action, and the characters are well acted and developed (as was done in the first 2 X-men--not 2 dimensional like X-Men 3).If I had to find a flaw, I would only say that there was a lack in originality. Much borrowed from the original movies (which were well done as I said) but some scenes were also reminiscent of Spiderman and The Matrix. Fans of the comic books will also find the humour in the small references to the original comics (including the cover of the first issue).In all, I was very pleased to finally have Superman return to the big screen and be directed by Bryan Singer.",13,10,Riverwildmtl,"Jun 28, 2006",

6,Why the world needs another Superman...,"It was only when Lois started to type the follow up article to her article ""Why the world doesn't need Superman"" -- ""Why the world needs Superman"" -- that it hit me why I was so bored. She sits and looks at the screen blank. She doesn't know what to write - because not even Lois can answer why the world needs Superman. After investing 2hrs and 30mins I should be able to answer why the world needs Superman -- because Bryan Singer and team have been convincing me that we do need him. But do we? For me this film fails to live up to the hype because it has nothing new to say. Batman Begins had something new to say about character. XMEN had something of social relevance to say. But what is the underlying point of this Superman film? That if you don't testify in the witness box the person hell bent on world domination will get off and try again at world domination -- there isn't enough to sustain interest here. Especially a 2hr 30min film. It plays like the same old melodrama -- will Lois get with Superman -- will Superman stop the villain -- only with the new twist...is the kid Superman's --?? Of all the different directions this film could have taken, for me, it can't compete with the new offerings of comic book movies. From the guy that brought us XMEN - and XMEN 2 -- this film should have been better -- not just a rehash of the previous films -- and a showcase of new green screen special effects technology. And from what I could see on screen -- those flying background effects -- will not hold up well in the future.The acting was only as good as the material. Kate handled Lois well. But she wasn't suited for the role. She is just too young. Brandon will probably get better as the sequels churn out...Ultimately this movie didn't prove to me that the world needs another Superman. Yes he can push land mass into space - stop a plane from crashing to earth - and go weak at the knees to Kryptonite. But there has to be more to this character. And I didn't see that...at least not today -- hopefully when he returns again...",0,1,daybe25,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,"Magical, simply magical.","Superman Returns is magical; a two and a half hour epic adventure with plenty of amazing spectacles, but also packs a lot of heart and emotion to back it up. Bryan Singer pays a great and respectful homage to Richard Donner's 1978 original, and in doing so has also managed to top all of the previous Superman efforts. A large amount of credit has to go to Singer for pulling it all off, but a lot of credit also needs to go to new comer Brandon Routh, who does an absolutely amazing job in the title role. And if you ask me I'd say he does a much better job than any other previous actor who has played the role, and yes, that also includes Christopher Reeve. Routh plays his Clark Kent with a slight touch of klutziness, but it's the kind of klutziness that you know when your watching him it's all for show, it's not just him being a dummy. With Reeve's portrayal it was harder to tell if it was just good acting, or just an amateurish performance. Routh, who does look an awful lot like Reeve, does the Man of Steel justice by giving Superman a strong backbone and tries his best to fit in, but ultimately will always be looking through the window from the outside. There's a great presence about him, that much like Hugh Jackman in 2000's X-Men, just makes you go, ""Damn, they really picked the right guy.""Singer's directorial skills and previous experience with comic book films and Routh's performance isn't the only thing that Superman Returns has going for it. Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lex Luthor is also another nice gem. He's so devilishly diabolical and mean. You can't help but hate him, but at the same time you just love him for it. And I think you can tell he's channeling the essence of Gene Hackman's performance in this film. Kate Bosworth also does a fine job as Lois Lane. I enjoyed her a lot more than Margot Kidder's loopy performance, but Bosworth really has some depth and strength that makes her character really work so well. And James Marsden aka ""Cyclops"" for those of you who don't know plays Lane's husband, Richard White. I loved the little love triangle between Lois, Richard and Superman throughout the film, it added just the right amount of heart and emotional depth to the big scale excitement.Right from the start the film hit me in the heart, with its amazing opening credits and blaring music; which was a great tribute to the original film. Thankfully Singer is a great director, and knows that if it isn't broke don't try and fix it. I'm glad that they were able to tie in John Williams' original theme (which I can't get out of my head as I write this, and I don't much want to either) as well as a little bit of Marlon Brando's performance, and that last shot of Superman at the end was a great nod to Christopher Reeve as well. I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a little misty eyed throughout the film. What can I say? This film hit me with a case of serious nostalgia like I've never felt before.So what's Superman Returns all about? Well it's about Superman… and his return to Earth, of course! The film isn't a sequel, prequel or remake; its set after 1980's Superman II, and ties into the first two films rather nicely. Their not exactly essential viewing in order to understand the plot of Returns, but I'm sure you could appreciate it more, or make it a little easier to follow if you saw the first two films. Superman returns to Earth after a mysterious absence of five years to find that the world might not need him. Well, at least that's the way Lois Lane sees things. But Superman shows the world once again that the world does need a savior and that no one's better suited for the job than the Man of Steel. Lex Luthor's back to his usual evil deeds, and he's out to destroy both the U.S. and Superman once and for all!Superman Returns is epic storytelling with grand spectacles and heart-felt emotion running through its veins, not seen since Jackson's King Kong. Singer remains faithful to spirit of the comics, and keeps the tension and suspense going from beginning to end. He doesn't feel the need to make things edgier, or darker, because that just wouldn't be Superman. After having seen what Singer has done on this film and the X-Men movies, I believe he could pretty much do any comic book superhero out there and make it a knockout film. I've always found the character of Superman to be a sign of great inspiration, and an icon to hold in high regard for doing the right thing, and fighting for justice and truth, and I still do. And as a die-hard fan I can say with confidence that I couldn't have ask for anything more than what I got. I can't wait to see what Superman will do next, and with Routh's great performance and Singer pulling out all the stops and pushing things to the max is what makes Superman Returns one of the year's best films. This is why I love going to the movies.",3,3,nived84,"Jun 28, 2006",
6,"For those nostalgic of 1978 Superman movie, not more","In 1978, a ferocious Lex Luthor sought to destroy California to create a real estate boom in the desert. Christopher Reeve, not rippling with muscles, had exhibited confident strength, patriotism, and over-riding concern for his Daily Planet compatriots as he foils the evil plot using super-human prowess.In 2006, we now have more of the same. While filmed and released 30 years apart, the two scripts could have been written side-by-side. As a 2 1/2 hour film, there could have been so much more plot development. Instead, this film stretches out the action scenes to give them a more pregnant but punctuated resolution by the man of steel. Unlike Batman Begins, where viewers were rewarded by the protagonist working through and overcoming his adversities, Superman walks past them and leaves his character ""dehumanized.""As an ""angelic"" soldier his patriotism is inspiring, but his muted, nearly dispassionate interaction with others left me feeling that the script was only half-baked.

This is as close to perfect as a Superman comic fan could ask for. Forget the few that claim that Lois had too much of a roll, or that there was too much romance. Those are the people who want to be bombarded with special effects the entire time, and not have any character development. Every single character was right on the money. I was hesitant to like Brandon Routh, but he inspired me as Supes, and was just as bumbling as Reeve when he was Clark. Parker Posey was ideal as the lovely assistant to Lex. She was hysterical, and dull witted, yet caring in the end. Kevin Spacey was great as Lex. I liked the idea of getting his $$ from the widow. He was diabolical, and brilliant. Jimmy Olsen had a small part, but he was eager and annoying. Perry wasn't expanded on too much, but I enjoyed his performance as well. The one and ONLY thing that i thought was a bit lacking was interaction between Supes, and Lex. They didn't even meet up until the end. That would have bumped it up to a 10 for me.

9,This Return is Super,"With Batman Begins it was proved that a hobbled comic book film franchise could be resurrected and improved, overshadowing the mediocrity that had preceded it. When Bryan Singer took the reins of Superman Returns, he had a similar job, but a different vision than Christopher Nolan had with Begins: Singer, a reported huge fan of Richard Donner's original Superman, wished to revitalize Superman without ignoring the grand moments of his past, specifically Superman and Superman II. It was a tall order, but his two turns behind the camera of X-Men and X2 proved he had the chops to make it happen, if matched with the right script. The final result is as good as you could imagine, and better than some might expect, as Superman Returns proves to not only be the original Superman's equal, but in some ways outdistances it. It is rare to see a famous character returned to lofty heights so gloriously.Superman Returns opens with Superman (Brandon Routh) having gone missing from Earth for five years. He has sought out the remains of the planet Krypton, with a desire to find out if it was destroyed as thought. Upon returning to his adopted home planet, Superman, and his alter ego, Clark Kent, visits with his mother briefly (portrayed by Eva Marie Saint), and then returns to Metropolis, where he finds things very similar to when he left, with Perry White (Frank Langella) still running the paper, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still snapping photographs, and Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) still in search of the big story. However, time has not been completely kind to the Man of Steel: Lois has moved on, living with Richard White (James Marsden) and now a mother with a son, Jason (Tristan Lake Lebeau).Coincident with Superman's Return is that of Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), out of prison and hatching a dastardly scheme: he raids Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steals the crystals that power it, with the intention to grow a new land mass that will supplant the United States and allow him to blackmail the world. Superman must now face this threat while trying to deal with the emotional aftermath of his long absence.Superman Returns delivers what you would expect from a comic book adaptation, complete with impressive action sequences, stunning visual effects, and some nice, sly humor at times. However, what is sometimes missing in other films is very much in place here: a strong emotional undercurrent, a respect for character and a moving romantic element. Superman Returns takes what was good about the original Superman and invests it with more depth and allows Superman to meet a challenge greater than any evil plot: the emotional fallout of losing that which is so dear to him, Lois Lane. Superman II investigated the love of Superman and Lois when they were together, here it is the longing when the one you love has moved on.Singer, with screenwriters Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, have also stepped up the character of Lex Luthor significantly. Gene Hackman's performance as Luthor was a great treat, but the Luthor in Superman Returns is a much more worthy villain. Lex has been away in prison for years, and the resentment has festered, along with his still grand desire for power. This is an evil, dirty Luthor, who still quips off a one-liner or two, but has a lot more menace than he ever did before. Spacey delivers the role excellently, with the perfect sardonic, sarcastic tone when necessary, giving way to pure venom and hatred as appropriate.It is obvious throughout Superman Returns that Bryan Singer holds a strong reverence for Richard Donner's original. The film, in many ways, is almost something of a remake of Superman, hitting many of the same story beats, and in doing so the film proves to be very much of a piece with 1978 classic and it's sequel. Between familiar lines restated, and character motivations that match the earlier films, Singer boldly states his love of that original film and how much he is ensuring not to tarnish it.The big question that has to be asked is: Is Brandon Routh up to filling the red boots and blue tights? The answer is an unequivocal yes. He slips effortlessly into the part, embodying Christopher Reeve's original take so masterfully as to be almost unnoticed. He performance is spot on perfect, and he has the role for as long as he wants to keep it. Bosworth offers a somewhat different take on Lois than Margot Kidder, but not a poor one. She is still the crusading reporter, but now holding in a certain amount of resentment and heartbreak that give her character some new shadings.Another strength of Superman is the skillful blending of John Williams' original themes from Superman with new score by composer John Ottman. Unlike X2, where he chose to retain none of Michael Kamen's music from X-Men, Ottman is aware of the classic status of what he is dealing with, and shows appropriate respect and deference. The film's visual effects are also impressive, giving you a great sense of the wonder of Superman flying. Singer has used the effects to stage some great sequences, such as when Superman saves a plane in danger, but it doesn't just use spectacle for spectacle sake, there is meat to the attractive bones here.All that being said, Superman Returns isn't perfect. The first segment of the film bogs down a little bit, there are some plot holes that aren't appropriately plugged and Frank Langella is miscast as Perry White (he is a little too gruff as the Daily Planet editor). But aside from that, Superman Returns is as close to a masterstroke in comic book films as you get. This is one that is truly worth the title Superman.",2,4,rparham,"Jun 28, 2006",

Superman has always been my favorite superhero, and I was worried, and excited about what I would see.Anyways, without wasting anymore time, I basically found this movie incredible. Story was smart and fits perfectly after superman 2. The actors were great choices (brandon, Kate, Kevin all played their parts perfectly - any changes they might have made on the acting were justifiably so). The music/score was perfect and the mix of action, comedy and romance was great. The movie gave superman a big challenge (we got to see superman in action), and opened up a lot of things during the movie to leave way for sequels (superman is back).SPOILER:: I just wished that Superman had at least 1 or 2 scenes where you could see him over power some guy (a guy punches him and gets hurt, superman takes a guy's hand and you hear a crack and see the guys pain as superman throws him to the wall/ground... or just ties the guy up).BACK TO NO SPOILERS:: Batman was successfully brought back, and now Superman has been excellently brought back. I just wish that if they make another 2 Superman's and Batman's, and then IF they make a ""superman and batman"" movie, that they keep it realistic (that's the reason why I liked this movie so much).

I was not even that impressed by the effects. I was put off right away even by the opening credits, which felt a bit cheesy to me. The pace was very slow, and even so, the movie lacked depth in some areas that I feel were missed opportunities.There are opportunities to hear what is on Superman's mind, and he is basically reduced to one line of dialog. I think that is what is really missing here - there was no depth in the dialog for Superman. Lois has a bit, but it's not enough.

While this movie presented me with a nice assortment of action and save the day scenes, I would describe it as a human interest story about a troubled Superman searching for answers and trying to find his place. Bryan Singer of the X-Men movie fame has done a wonderful job of combining these concepts into the new Superman Returns.This is very much a story about Superman/Clark Kent (and I must say that Brandon Routh delivers a pleasantly and well crafted interpretation of the original Christopher Reeve style and performances from the Richard Donner movie).It opens as Superman has returned to Earth following a five-year absence This movie is more polished and correctly cut than the original that it continues with this new story line. This movie is obviously designed to emulate the original but has a nice combination of old 40's mixed with current look and feel appearances creating a much better look and is very believable. I found the production art work effective creating this nostalgic atmosphere that drew me into the whole feel of the comic book superman story. This was not campy or comical, it was charming and delightful. As I moved through the characters (and Singer does a nice job of carefully introducing the characters) I actually started to care. This movie is softer and more respective of how we are introduced to the feelings each character is struggling with. Now I will say that some characters are there to only support what is going on with the main characters and you don't get much out of them, but it doesn't really matter, the real focus is the main characters. That works reasonable well.Singer's decision to reuse the original John Williams' classic theme music from the original works rather well since it has been re-tooled and freshened up with a new arrangement. I was kind of taken back with a delighted sense of remembrance of when I first saw the original movie. Marlon Brando's original performance from the original movie is used sparingly and to appropriate use tin order to recreate the Jor-El father of Kal-El (Superman's real name). For people who remember, this will be a nice treat. For people that do not care, there is no distraction…it really works with or without your foreknowledge.Lex Luthor (played by Kevin Spacey) is back again having been released from jail on apparent technicalities. Many were afraid, as I was that this would revisit the campy and comical, but well played performance of Gene Hackman. It doesn't. Spacey is cold, smooth, insane and full of his own self-worth and alleged genius, but he delivers a nice wicked interpretation of Lex. This worked for me. I wanted a more established super villain as was created in the DC Comics where he was a multi-billionaire of vast corporate criminal schemes working behind the scenes. But this is clearly a tribute to the vision Richard Donner created for Lex Luther in the original movie. This as well also worked for me, because Bryan Singer leads you into his vision and carefully prepares the story to help you get caught up it this way.The Story is simple but never boring. The action is not driving, wall to wall demonstrations put there to fill space with action for thrill junkies. The action and special effects are there to support and tell the story and belong. It is filled with exciting scenes and amazing special effects, but I liked the fact that the special effects and action were not the stars of the movie, but that Superman and the main characters were.By the time the two and half hours were up, I said wow that went fast. I was not worn out. This is an uplifting and memorable film that will appeal to men and women alike. It is smart and emotional as well as fun and full of super heroic action.I would have liked a fresh and original take on Superman more closely related to the current exploits in DC comics today (there are several really amazing story lines) but this continuation of the Richard Donner Superman series is well done, nicely updated and true to the spirit that Christopher Reeves and Richard Donner created in that version. I enjoyed this movie surprisingly well. You will find it infectious and easy to be sucked into the story. I found it fairly easy to suspend disbelief during the film and enjoy Bryan Singers nostalgic trip into the Richard Donner Superman series with what really appears to be Superman III (you have to forget the original 3rd and 4th movies ever were made, which is not hard to do). Don't be scared away by the nay Sayers, this on is fun and worth seeing.",0,1,bortrea,"Jun 28, 2006",

10,Bad reviews for a Great movie...,"Before going to see this film I read about a half dozen reviews, all of which cast the film in a negative light. I had long worried that this film (as many late sequels tend to) would just add another bad story to one of the great iconic characters of our time (see Superman 3 and 4 for examples of what I mean). The reviews had told me that the movie started slow.. and after the opening credits were over, I began to agree.. for about 5 minutes.Before I give my actual opinion let me make it clear what type of person is giving it. I do NOT own any Superman items of any sort, I do not collect Superman comics or sit around watching Superman movies all the time (though I am a Smallville Fan). Furthermore I am an individual who almost never chooses a favorite... nothing to me is ever the 'best' or 'worst'.. merely good or bad. I am however an avid reader and movie goer with a fairly huge appreciation for good stories.Having established that, let me state plainly that this may be one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.This is a long movie...I will admit that after two hours had passed I began to look at my watch, but not because I was eager for the movie to end, because I wanted to know how much more of this film I had before me to enjoy.Everything about this film came together beautifully, the story, the writing, the acting, the effects, the editing, the direction, the continuity with the other films... I couldn't find anything truly wrong with it. Okay well.. I can always find SOMETHING to complain about and if I had to pick something in this film it would be that they don't spend much time on what Supes found or did while he was gone for a few years (maybe we can look forward to some deleted scenes on the DVD?).This movie has it all, for everybody. The action is amazing, the special effects are used with amazing fluidity, the love story is tragic and believable (once you buy in to the idea of a god like alien in the guise of a superhero in red underwear), the plot twists are just predictable enough to be easily accepted without being obvious and insulting to your intelligence... I could go on forever saying good things about this movie.Suffice it to say that I will be seeing it more than once in theaters and will DEFINITELY be buying it on DVD.",1,2,Chapel1979,"Jun 28, 2006",
7,One of the best but not quite the best!,"This was a very good superhero movie. I would say that it is one of the best behind Batman, Superman, X2 and Spiderman 2. Brandon Routh does a great job as Superman but not quite the bumbling Clark Kent that Christopher Reeve was. I think that Kate Bosworth was decent although a bit young looking as Lois Lane. I really liked James Marsden as Richard White and I thought that Kevin Spacey did a good job as Lex Luthor. It would have been nice to see even more of Lex. I also wish that they would have told more of why Superman left and what he was doing. I enjoyed the special effects as well as the touching twist at the end. Overall, an enjoyable superhero movie that should be spawning some sequels.",0,1,toadfan,"Jun 28, 2006",
6,"Decent, but nothing great.....","So, I went into this movie not really expecting much as the trailers didn't look that good. I'd say all in all it was a decently entertaining movie, worth watching if you have nothing else to do, but clearly not on par with Batman Begins or Spider-man. Unlike the other two, it just didn't have the same superhero feel. Bryan Singer tried to give Superman more of a human touch by making him more vulnerable, which is all well-and-good, but in doing so, he took away the things which makes a superhero movie fun in the first place......Anyways, I'd say it's worth watching in the theater just cause it's a Superman movie, but if that's not really a big deal for you, I'd wait for the rental.....",1,1,ajain5,"Jun 28, 2006",

6,Superman sequel or 3 hr film of recycled film.,"In my opinion the best part of this film was Marlon Brando's voice overs. Wait for DVD... this film is too long, to slow and its nothing you have not seen before. Brandon Routh was a nice pick but other that there is not much here for people who like good movies. This comment however is coming from a fan of Fassbinder, Michael Haneke's work. If you can stomach a film for the masses this film is right up your alley. Want to see a good movie go watch Dunstin Checks In. Thats a classy Story. A monkey and a boy causing crazy antics and making trouble. You have to love it. I know I do.

10,"""Superman Returns"" is a Super Maniac Movie!","Brian Signer's ""Superman Returns"" contains Gothic Elements in relation to the Seven Deadly Sins, High/overwrought Emotions, Storms, Death, Women threatened by a powerful and impulsive male, Supernatural events, Atmosphere of mystery and suspense, The outcast, Powerful Love, Madness, and finally the woman that is in distress.At the beginning of the movie we get to learn how Lex comes across his money. His betrayal to an old lady put the cash in his hand. Her castle and assets now belong to Lex. The first Gothic element that is seen is the Castle. This castle has Gothic architecture - including the ceilings, outside build of the castle, and finally where it is situated on the land. This dark and gloomy place is where Lex performs his first's experiments to wipe out North America.Upon view this movie I have noted that the opening scene is to be set in the 1960's. This evident due to the traffic cars and lifestyle. However, a boy is seen taking a picture of Superman with a camera phone.The Seven Deadly Sins in this movie were evident, however, only a few appeared to be actually in relation to this film. Lex Luthor as we know is avarice and has had this trait since the comic was started many years ago, in noting that he also has Pride, Anger, and is Sloth like. Lex's result in the movie is when he ends up stranded on the island to which he wanted to create - with no gas and that non omniscient woman he is always with. Lust was evident with Superman and Lois Lane, although this lust has always been there between the two of them it was the fact that we became more sentient to this. The result of this in the movie was that Lois once again was left alone. Envy was seen by the city people who Superman promptly saved when there was a problem - there was no result to this.Although this writer has never saw a Signer film before, I must say that his way of portraying Lex was extremely well done! Signer made Lex the perfect impulsive male. Lex has always been the manipulator in this series. His actions justified it so. Lex's role is like the juxtaposition where Hell and Earth meet.As we all know that the woman in distress is always going to be Lois Lane. It seems no matter where she is she just has bad luck. Superman conveniently is seen dashing in to save his damsel.You are probably thinking - ""Who is the outcast""? Well, near the end of the movie there is literature left for us to believe that Lois' son is indeed that of Clark's as well. This child has no friends and probably never will. This is our outcast. Living his life to it fullest potential will be his goal and to be like Superman is what this boy desires.The only thing that I found about this movie that I really did not care for was the fact that the director did not seem to ""run out of tape"" - if you will. This movie was extensively long. Multiple times when I thought that the movie had ended it however, did not.All in all, if all of the elements above appear to you as something that is of interest - I strongly recommended viewing this movie. The writers and director of this film did a marvelous job!! If you honestly do not like comics or reading, you can still view this movie without difficulty in comprehending the events throughout this film.BRAVO BRIAN SIGNER!!! My sourcing: I recently completed a Gothic Literature course. This course and being analytical is what has created this review. Hopefully, my thoughts and knowledge have encouraged you to view this film.Note: This work was not cited from any other URL.",2,3,Mike20012002,"Jun 28, 2006",

6,Another Great Achievement for Singer,"Ever since I was a kid, and I used to watch a beat up old copy of Superman 2 we had lying around the house, I've been a huge fan of the comic book-come-myth of the Man of Steel. Quoting lines from the first and second films became part of a daily routine. Certain series like 'Smallville' and 'Lois & Clark' kept the fans' flame warm for a long time, but over 20 years after we had a decent Superman movie, the expectations were set inexorably higher than what is expected from films in general these days, making the cast and crew's job even more difficult. Given these insurmountable tasks, and having set my standards quite high myself, I am glad to say that Singer has delivered (as he has many times in the past) a high-quality production. Especially from a directorial standpoint, Singer's work shines. A short description here would be far too inefficient to imagine the kind of mastery involved to make movies of this magnitude, but his attention to detail, innovation, and ability to coax the best from his actor's and crew, certainly increases my appreciation for this work and all his other endeavors. Cinematography was masterful, and special effects otherworldly... that having been said, I had a few misgivings about the film after my initial viewing. Filling the shoes of Academy Award Winner Gene Hackman seems a daunting enough task, but trying to create a character as likable yet devious as the original Lex Luthor, has proved nigh impossible. Though Spacey, a strong and thorough actor, has proved himself many times over, I felt his interpretation of Lex was a little over the top. He just seemed like a crazy cynic, bent on destroying everyone, with neither reason nor motive. His so-called ""support"", Kal Penn and Parker Posey, among others, did little for the film whatsoever, and deserved little if any credit (I was surprised to see their named displayed so prominently in the opening credits). Likewise, Frank Langella, a veteran in the film world, did little to reprise the role of Perry White, an important and quirky (for lack of a better word) character in the story. On the other hand, luckily, Routh and Bosworth both pulled through in their roles. Nothing too dynamic, but Routh did a great job emulating the geekiness and uncertainty of the Kent character, and simultaneously showing us (mostly through bulk and posture) the confident and invincible character of Superman. Bosworth, through certain subtleties was able to communicate Lois' fragility, masked by feelings of self-importance and strength, that she characteristically tends to show, (luckily, she ain't so hard on the eyes either). Overall, I wonderful film that I would recommend to all. Enjoyable on all levels, for all ages (which is always good for gross), and definitely, merits a second viewing. Though the memories of Reeve, Hackman and Kidder will forever live on, Singer's production pays homage to the original films, and carries forth the legend with competence, integrity and ingenuity. From an old fan, 8 of out 10 stars. - NV",1,2,naimvojdani9,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Superman is back in one of the best superhero movies ever.,"A message to all Super-Fans: this is one you do not want to miss. Superman has truly returned, and with him he has brought the hopes, fears and challenges of a new generation. Brandon Routh is superb as Superman and Clark Kent, lending an easy air of nobility to Superman, and affecting a Reeve-ian approach to Clark Kent- gentle and clumsy. Indeed, Chris Reeve's stamp can be felt in many places in this film. Brian Singer has done a marvelous job of paying homage to the original while branching off in a new direction. Supporting cast are all excellent: Kate Bosworth is better than expected as Lois Lane- steely, spurned and direct, but vulnerable where the script demands it. Kevin Spacey is delightfully evil as Lex Luthor, turning in a hammy performance. James Marsden is a welcome addition as Lois's love interest Richard White in his second superhero film this year, and Frank Langella makes a return to celluloid as Perry White, editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet. We saw the film last night at the AMC Empire in Times Square. Theater experience was just OK- would have been better in digital or IMAX (both were sold out weeks ago). Action sequences were incredible; it's rumored that the film cost almost $300 million, and all of it is up on the screen. The special effects were incredible and highly detailed, the score by John Ottman includes the venerated theme by John Williams and expands on it in a bombastic, powerful score. Opening credit sequence is a delight to watch, and the film is dedicated to Chris and Dana Reeve.

8,"Super great for everyone who has seen and enjoyed the previous Superman movies, and GREAT for who hasn't","After a long wait, I finally get to see the Superman Returns. I don't think I need to tell you the main plot here, you can see it for yourself.Let me break my comment down in two categories: First, to anyone who has seen previous Superman films, this movie is a very nolstalgic movie, especially to anyone who grew up in those years. The first Superman movie I saw was Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987). Well as a 7 years old kid, that movie completely blew me away. I mean, before the movie I knew Superman from the comic only and to see him to fly in action was out of this world. Anyhow, I finally got to see the other Superman movies and I can honestly agree that the first and second one were much better than the rest, but the fourth one with Nuclear Man was still like my first love.Well, let's get back to the Superman Returns, I said that it's super great since it retains the universe that was left in the first and second Superman and also the story continuity. It still has the same Daily Planet office (albeit with computers and plasma TVs, instead of just typewriters). The Metropolis feels like Metropolis we knew before. Even the clothes of the characters are still somewhat in a similar era of the first and second Superman. Ow yeah and the cars, I know it's a bit strange, but when I saw the movie I got the feeling that the cars are in the same time period of the previous Superman. I mean, I didn't see any modernly pimped out cars or any hybrid SUV's around, which didn't exist back in late 1970's-1980's. The cars look... classic, I guess, although I did recognise some obvious modern cars. I think Bryan Singer and the rest of the production crews had done a wonderful job in retaining the Superman we knew.Second, to anyone who has not seen previous Superman films, this movie is an excellent summer blockbuster movie. The visual effect is first rate. This means that the effect is enough to awe viewers without trying to be over the top and too out of this world. It has also something to do with the plot where the writers did such a great job. Without giving out anything, any new Superman viewer will be able to understand the story without watching the other Superman movies, but I recommend you to see the others (just the one and two only!). Everyone knows that Superman is a saviour, well in this movie he is one, too. But the threat to the world is enough to give him trouble, without being too silly, which is in conjunction with what I said about the visual effect.The actors were great. The cast selection was amazing. Brandon Routh is the new Superman for the new generation. He did a great job, as good as how Christian Bale delivered the new Batman in Batman Begins. Kevin Spacey is always ever a great actor. Parker Posey gave an enough presence without being too shiny, which is enough for her role. James Marsden did a great job, although I still portrayed him as the Cyclops from X-Men. Frank Langella was perfect as Perry White, although I was very excited to hear Hugh Laurie was the first choice. I guess it's cool to see the mad doctor House yells at a bunch of reporters to get news of Superman. Kate Bosworth, I love her. She's great. Every time I heard her name, it always reminded me of Blue Crush and her cute surfer chick character. But now... Kate Bosworth equals Superman Returns. One complaint though, I think the costume department should have given her a smaller outfit. I mean her clothes is fit, but there were some scenes, especially the outdoor ones, when she wears jacket and the jacket seems to be too large. I don't know, it's just my opinion though.But this film is not without any flaw. I find the length is a bit too long. I had to run out to pee, which I don't normally do. I don't really know why I complain about the length, because normally it's never enough for me. However, there were moments that I want to skip some part and get to the action. I guess all I wanted was more action for the Superman.So go and see it. It kicks ass. Ow yeah, make sure you enjoy the greatness of Panavision Genesis HD. I am gonna see Superman Returns again in IMAX.",1,2,ian-purnomo,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,This review is dedicated to Christopher Reeve.* * * * *,"""Superman IV:The Quest for Peace"" was a bomb back in 1987.The first two films were amazingly outstanding.But when it got to the third installment,there was nowhere for the film to go.It seemed that the ""Superman"" franchise was dead.Now after nearly two decades of going through ""Batman"",""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"",it seems that the franchise has returned.And thanks to director Bryan Singer,the franchise has returned with an explosive bang.This film is true at what it sets out to do.It reminds us ,or let us say,it reminded me of my childhood when I was watching 1978s ""Superman:The Movie"".The visual effects are better although I still prefer the flying effects in the 1978 version.In that version,you knew that Christopher Reeve was in front of a screen with background images with a specially designed camera that moved around him.In""Superman Returns"",the technology has risen to a point to which we actually believe he could fly.Both films are as entertaining as the next.Brandon Routhe is incredible as Clark Kent and Superman.Watching the film,I could not help but notice how much of that Christopher Reeve Personality was in him.I am 34.I felt like a 6 year old watching the film.""Superman Returns"" flies high but at the same time it tries not to outdo the first two films.Watching both ""Superman III""-""IV"" sadly lacked what ""Superman Returns"" brought back.The humor is a crucial point to the film.I may be out of hand,but in my opinion,""Superman Returns"" may be the best film of 2006.Brandon Routhe is the correct choice for the two roles that he plays.As Superman,he is truly one of the best actors to play the character.I thought I was looking at Christopher Reeve's twin.With Brandon Routhe donning the tights and Bryan Singer directing the sequels-hopefully-it would be interesting to see how far this series could go.With this film,I was convinced and I was happy.""Superman Returns"" is the most entertaining film of 2006.",3,5,davidslicer,"Jun 28, 2006",
6,Who's the real hero: Superman or Singer?,"I haven't posted a comment in sometime, but after having watched Superman Returns opening night, I feel compelled.I admit I had my reservations upon reading the cast and seeing publicity photos. Being a big fan of the original, I wasn't convinced how it would measure up. But I also had faith in Bryan Singer's talent.I have to say this movie seemed to deliver on just about every level. It will appeal to almost any audience; fan's of the original, comic book fanboys (such as myself), and those young one's experiencing the spirit of the Man of Steel for the first time. My biggest reservation going into this was the cast. Let's face it, there will NEVER be another Christopher Reeve. But if Reeve was ever given an intern, the result would definitely be Brandon Routh and his performance. Routh seemed to capture the essence of the character throughout the majority of the movie. There were times his look resembled Reeve, and even times where his voice seemed eerily the same! Kate Bosworth didn't sell me on the character of Lois until the second half of the movie, but I was rooting for her by the end. Lex Luthor was a tough part to cast, and Kevin Spacey did a fine job, as did the rest of the supporting cast. The real hero here is Bryan Singer. This man is quickly becoming one of my fave directors. I know he won't be stuck solely in this genre, but I have to say the man has the heart of a true comic fan. After seeing the film, I'm not as upset at him for leaving X-3. He made a sequel all this time later in a manner that fits very well. The story, the look, the effects, the characters, the sets, and most of all...the heart in this movie all come together to make it a wonderful experience. I am truly relieved that he was able to successfully breath new life into a franchise that was much needed (much the same way the Batman Begins prequel was able to do). Like King Kong and Peter Jackson did in the winter, I was reminded of what a great experience going to the theater can be. This is what summertime at the movies is all about!",1,2,pktbishop,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Awesome!!!!!,"It was fantastic. I had a stupid grin on my face from the opening credits to the heartwarming dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeves at the end. Hearing John Williams' theme song sent chills down my spine! I didn't know if Bryan Singer would keep the original theme, but really, in retrospect, how could he not? The film was entirely respectful to the original films, yet he added new elements which I think will take the franchise far.Brandon Routh was stunning and perfectly cast. There were moments in the film when I thought I could see a bit of Christopher Reeves' spirit shining through Brandon's smile and gestures. The similarities were striking and a little eerie.Kevin Spacey ROCKED!!! I wasn't sure about Kate Bosworth playing Lois, but her chemistry with Brandon convinced me.All in all, a wonderful movie and I look forward to seeing it in IMAX!!",1,2,mimers00,"Jun 28, 2006",

4,Superman Returns Didn't Fly With Me,"You know, I can't bash Superman for what it is. It was a good story, the script could have been a little better. The actors were OK, except for Lois who seemed completely whiney through the whole movie, and Rouch just didn't have enough life in his character. I mean, he seemed a little mum through-out the whole movie. But altogether, I thought it was OK. Here's my problem, Bryan Singer. Just like in X-Men, He spends 2 hours trying to make you feel for the characters and spends only 30 minutes on action. THIS MOVIE NEEDED MORE ACTION TO IT! oh no, Lex stole a crystal, threw it in the ocean, and plans to take over the world, that's the best script they can come up with in 15 years? I don't know, I'm tired of paying good money and having my legends of my youth bashed by a director who wants me to feel the love between his characters. This is Superman not The Notebook.

5,Bryan Singer Stay away from My Comic Book Heroes,"Despite all the money spent ($204 million) and the hype, Superman Returns, is unfortunately a big disappointment. The special effects are spectacular: Superman looks great flying around, better than we have ever seen him before (although I'm not sure about changing the colors of his suit). Too bad the plot and the characters suffer.The evil genius Lex Luther is downgraded to a mere con-artist who's diabolical scheme is, once you think about it, stupid and pointless. Despite having proved himself to be a supremely evil mastermind, Lex is out and free in the world (the explanation for how this occurs is, to put it lightly, lame). More attention is payed to Lois Lane and her life in this movie then ever before, yet I never grew close to Lois' character. She comes across as very 2 dimensional, essentially a flat character. There should be a massive struggle going on for Lois, but we're treated only to rare glimpses of this internal angst.As for Superman... well unfortunately the director and writers decided to focus largely on the first two Superman movies. Brandon Routh brings little to the Superman character that is different from what Christopher Reeves brought. Herein lies the mistake. Reeves was innovative in his approach to the role, especially what he did with ""Clark,"" (the slumped shoulders, bumbling and clumsy manner). Routhe has admitted he greatly admires what Reeves did with the character, and its obvious to viewers that both Routhe and Singer (director) are doing their best to emulate Reeves' portrayal. The final product is just that, an attempt to copy Reeves that ultimately leaves you only wanting the original. Routhe's decision to change little is, however, not the worst blow to the Superman character.In ""Superman Returns,"" Singer and the writers make the decision to focus on one of the worst parts of the original Superman movies---Superman's decision to sleep with Lois and then erase her memory afterwards. This kind of action is extremely out of character for Superman and never should have been done in the first place (I blame lazy writers). I mean, you can't just sleep with someone you're in love with and who's in love with you, and then just erase their memory afterwards without their knowledge or consent. That's just un-Supermanesque and should have been ignored in the later movies. Instead Singer and co decide to build on this week storyline. What we get in ""Superman Returns"" is a Superman character who acts very... normal (even petty)in his ongoing relationship with Lois.The end result of the director's over-focus on the original Superman movies is that there is little of anything that is new in this movie. Five movies later and Superman is still fighting Lex Luther... a man you would think the world authorities would be able to put away forever without Superman's help. Batman not only takes out criminals of the same magnitude as Superman does, but he does so with finality. It's obviously time for a new villain for Superman to face, but Singer offers up only a repeat of the past. Bottom line: don't expect anything new or original.",5,5,lrosco,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,An Amazing Film with 1 or 2 Exceptions,"In two words, ""Loved it"". From the clever handling of the Superman character (a character that, for all intents and purposes, must be the hardest superhero character to tackling) to the ingenious tie ins with the first two films (this film is technically the new Superman 3) all down to the surprisingly amazing performance of Kate Bosworth (who knew?). The visuals and photography are amazing. Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Parker Posey, and James Marsden are all incredible in the film. My only real complaint would be the performance of Brandon Routh. While his Clark Kent had moments of acting genius, his Superman left me lacking. He felt very disconnected to the character through most of it and his experience (or lack thereof) definitely showed through when put next to the aforementioned performances. Unfortunately, his best acting moments were when he stopped talking, or making facial gestures of any kind, and just flew around and did his thing. Many of you will say, ""Well, that's the point"" My response to that is, ""Then couldn't any of us been Superman in this film and done just as well."" That aside, still an incredible movie and I was completely blown away by it. Definitely a must see.",1,2,rfs101,"Jun 28, 2006",
6,The Whole Was Not Greater then the Sum of It's Parts,"Okay, so Superman (the first movie) is probably one of my favorite films of all time. So this film almost slavishly tried to recreate the feeling of the first movie, but to paraphrase Max Bialystock from ""The original version of ""The Producers""How could this happen? I was so careful. I picked the right movie, the right director, the right cast. Where did I go wrong?Well, first of all, yes Singer picked all the right things, but for some reason, the entire film never gels. You go ""Gosh wow!"" where you're supposed to, but those moments pass. Brandon Routh was wonderful as the Man of Steel, and had he been given the sort of script Chris Reeve was give, I have no doubt he could have carried it off as well. However, there was no taking off the glasses and saying: ""Lois, I have something to tell you."" There was no earth-shaking scream when he realizes Lois is dead, and There is no screw you Jorel when he goes back in time to undo her death. There is: ""You have something of mine."" How original.....NOT. Kevin Spacey I had no doubts about. He did not fail my high expectations. As good as Gene Hackman in his own way. Parker Posey is no Valery Perrine. Kate Bosworth? Well, not to shabby, but did take some getting used to. But she was still, to crib a line from ""Lois and Clarke"" ""Galactically stupid"". So, it works like this. If you want to enjoy lots of expensive special effects, by all means, see this movie. Otherwise, rent the first of the Donner versions.",0,1,bear90,"Jun 28, 2006",
8,Good but not great (relatively spoiler free),"This, of course, had the potential to either be one of the greatest, most inspiring movies ever or the horrendous destruction of an iconic character. Well, it was neither.To those who can religiously quote the 1978 Donner version, prepare yourselves for Superman the Movie Part Deux. From plot line to dialog, this is a remake of that original gem. Sure, different locations and motivations in some cases, but it is basically a newer, occasionally prettier version. For those who have a pedestrian memory of the original, prepare to be wowed. The movie is gorgeous and exciting, and it generated hearty applause at the end.Personally, I fit into the former of these 2 groups. I was not blown away by this movie except for Brandon Routh, who more than filled Christopher Reeve's red boots while, sadly, speaking far-too-few lines. He is exceptional as The Man of Steel. I didn't for one second buy Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. Margot Kidder's gruff portrayal was infinitely more convincing and enjoyable. I would say the same for Lex Luthor. Spacey is a tremendous actor and his subtleties are what sets him apart from most, but he is nowhere near as good as Hackman. However, his shortcoming is due less to his own performance and more to the somewhat neutered role that he was portraying.Like I said, the movie is good but not great, but I expect that it will do tremendous business. I hope they amp up the action in the sequel and either make Lex a more worthy adversary or find someone who is...",1,2,tapsmiled,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Awesome Movie,"I saw it last night. I can't stop thinking about it. I grew up with Superman, and now that I'm a young adult,I had practically forgotten how much I loved it. After seeing this, I feel like a five-year-old again! I thought it was extremely well done, and I'm not sure why so many critics don't' like it. I think it's the best of the entire series! Lex Luthor is extremely well played, and after a few minutes of watching the movie, I didn't feel as though I was watching a different movie from the originals. I felt right at home with all the characters. My one problem with the movie is that the originals took place in the 70's/80's (based off of the technology/fashions of the time), and this one seems to take place in the present. my problem is that Lois Lane looks younger than she does in the originals! How old is she?!? Other than that, I thought it was a solid movie.",1,2,rushmaniac2003,"Jun 28, 2006",
7,Spacey is tremendous!,"First, a rant about 3-D movies. Let me say that I didn't mean to reserve tickets for a 3-D showing. I wanted to see Superman on the IMAX screen and didn't realize that the IMAX version was also a 3-D version. I find 3-D movie screenings really annoying. It makes sense that people in the 50s were into them because technology was so peachy-keen back then--people would try anything as long as it was new and cool. But high technology, to me at least, is a little more routine these days, so I want my high tech gadgets to have real impact. At the very least, the impact should far outweigh the inconvenience or sheer corniness. 3-D movies don't make the cut, as far as I'm concerned. Those disposable plastic glasses are uncomfortable--they cut into the bridge of my nose--plus, they don't fit well over my own glasses. Not only that but, hello, DISPOSABLE? In 2006, should we really be finding new plastic crap that we use for 2 hours and then dump in a landfill where they'll last for hundreds of years? Not the best use of precious petroleum, in my opinion. OK, so that's little picture suddenly becoming very big picture (no IMAX or 3-D puns intended). Also, there's something undeniably campy about 200 people all putting on their 3-D glasses at once when they see the little flashing signal on screen--which, I guess, could be either fun or annoying, or both. Add to that the fact that the 3-D effect made scenes with rapid action difficult to focus on, and you begin to see the problem. I would MUCH rather have seen the movie on a big huge screen with really loud surround sound. So, if given the option, DON'T see this film on 3-D--at least, that's my vote.But do see the movie. Superman Returns is exactly that, the return of a movie franchise that's fun for the whole family. Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth are easy on the eyes, the special effects are quite good, and the Christian overtones are pretty overt and actually contribute just a little bit of moral heft to the picture, which I think I liked. Moreover, I think the movie avoided some of the production decisions that made the 1978 film age about 3 decades in 3 years.But I've determined that there is a first rule for making a comic book superhero movie. Somewhere down the list of rules, there are commandments like: have good special effects, get a John Williams score or something like one, get a hunky but wholesome male lead, get a lovely female lead, include a dog, call the city something else but let everyone know that it's really New York (even if you film it in Canada or Australia or wherever), etc. But Rule #1 should be: do whatever it takes, pay whatever is required, but get a top-notch actor to play the villain (a corollary of this rule should be to have only one villain). No offense to Christopher Reeve, but the liveliest moments in the 1978 Superman were scenes starring Gene Hackman. The same goes for Superman Returns. Brandon Routh is fine, but at best he's an ""everyman"" and at worst he's a cipher--he looks good in the costume, and he doesn't suck at acting Super. But Kevin Spacey is the guy in the movie who can act, and act he does. Spacey's performance here, as in so many other movies, is worth the price of admission. He's coldly sadistic, satirically humorous, brilliantly jaded, and, as Lex Luthor must inevitably be, ultimately bungling. Plus, he looks pretty good with no hair.I think we're in for more Superman movies. Let's hope the new franchise doesn't go the way of the Batman travesty. If the filmmakers remember the rules--especially Rule No. 1--they should be fine.P.S. Just a side note. It's hard to complain about looking at Kate Bosworth on a really big screen for 2 and half hours. The filmmakers knew this, and they included plenty of close-ups of all the film's leads. But she's no Lois Lane. Lois should be pretty and all, but she needs to have an edge to her, and Bosworth is all soft curves--no edges in sight. I'm not sure who should have played Lane, and Bosworth doesn't ruin the movie or anything, but she's just not quite right.",0,1,Kevin_Maness,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,You'll believe that a man can etc.,"Much better than expected. Superman Returns hits all the right notes and the casting is first rate. I had my doubts about Brandon Routh, but he pulls off the Superman/Clark Kent role and makes it look easy. Kevin Spacey is a better Lex Luthor than Gene Hackman, and Kitty may be Parker Posey's best work yet. Who knew she could act?The Lex Luthor story line is tightly plotted, which gives the Superman/Kent/Lois Lane story line time to develop into something more than you'd expect from a summer action movie. Subtle humor and good writing deliver a movie that doesn't condescend to the audience. Superman Returns blows the forgettable X-Men 3 out of the water.

8,Super Man does indeed return in an almost super way.,"The movie was well put together and exceeded my expectations after seeing recent titles that try to adapt from comic books and while the Superman series has a lot more to build on than other comic book titles out nowadays, I was still expecting much more of a hodge podge mix that is so common at present.The story was quite cohesive and the on screen presence of all the actors was quite strong, esp Brandon Routh though at times overshadowed by James Marsden as a counterpart. I esp. liked how James Marsden did not have to project any role of the corny 'evil' counterpart to Clark Kent and instead was more true to life, inspiring even at times. I do think Lex Luthor aka Kevin Spacey could have used a stronger presence on screen which may have been compromised in part by his hapless assistant, who although I realize is supposed to be that way, may take away from his credentials as the man who can take on SuperMan.Additionally, as the viewer you will find many scenes of humanity and emotion overflowing in the movie and it is purely on your sense of perception whether you find them to be relevant and genuine or contradictory and superfluous. It all depends if you hold true to old skool or not i think. I'll let u decide that for yourself.As a final note, whilst I may not have walked away feeling totally inspired or blown away from the movie, altogether, I truly did enjoy it (ie certain scenes either by way of cinematography or cast and direction will not soon be forgotten) and think that this was a great comeback which paid respects where they were due and has set in motion a stage for sequels to come.",0,1,mzkx,"Jun 28, 2006",
1,Superman Should Return to Krypton For Good,"People need to realize that just because special effects these days are so incredibly awesome (like in Superman Returns) that it doesn't justify it to be a great movie. Kevin Spacey was the only decent performance in this movie, as his darker comedic portrayal of Lex Luthor versus the goofy Gene Hackman version. The story was so ridiculously bland and boring I found myself laughing at the screen. In fact, the entire theater had burst out into laughter from the Curdled cheese fed to us through a ten dollar admission. The few and far between action sequences..IE: CG, kept my eyes glued to the screen. So all in all if you want to pay ten bucks I'm not going to stop you, just be sure to buy popcorn so that you are distracted enough. Now I have crime to fight, hold on a sec. let me take off my glasses, OK yeah, now let me curl my bangs, good, there now I can fight evil doers..up, up and oh read a book.",11,14,LostFootagePRD,"Jun 28, 2006",

10,Best movie of the summer,"Thank you Mr. Singer! I must admit, when I went to see Superman Returns, I went with some trepidation. Having enjoyed the X-men trilogy (though, not X-men 3 as much as the previous 2) I was a little concerned about the quality I would find in this latest vision of Superman. Fortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, there was no need for any kind of concern.I can honestly say that this movie is the best movie I have seen so far this year. The story was compelling (I found myself on the edge of my seat repeatedly), the acting was superb (Kevin Spacey was amazing), the characters were believable and extremely empathetic, and most importantly, Brandon Routh, if nothing else, was completely believable as Superman/Kal-el/Clark Kent. Perhaps he was just projecting himself in the blue-suit, or maybe it was just Singers phenomenal directing, but after about 15 minutes of watching the movie, I completely believed that I was watching Superman, not an actor 'playing' superman, as I did when I watched George Clooney 'playing' Batman. Thanks Mr. Singer for casting someone who we could envision as Superman...This movie has made my summer. Seriously, from start to finish I was awash in memories of my childhood, of watching Superman I & II -- this movie provides as seamless a bridge between my childhood, and my adulthood, as fluidly as any movie could.If you see one movie this summer... or even this year... make it Superman Returns, you will not regret it, and you just might be reminded of why we all wanted to 'fly like Superman' when we were children.",1,2,jared-112,"Jun 28, 2006",
,The Man Of Shame,"I will preface this review by saying that all good and great directors eventually lose their way and make a bad movie. Need proof just look at Steven Spielberg's resume. Bryan Singer has now joined the list.""Superman Returns"" is a debacle. A dull 2 and half hour, quarter of a billion dollar epic bore.Even the special effects fail to impress. Nothing super or special about them at all.The subplot involving his visit and return from Krypton is so unnecessary it just should have been Completely cut out. It was just a lazy excuse for his disappearance and the first example of poor storytelling.It's something that should have been shown. The audience is cheated out of this supposedly important subplot. It would have added some emotional substance. Visiting his home world for the first time and Impact it would have on his psyche.When in Smallville he barely speaks to his Mother, Martha and makes no attempt to visit Lana Lang.The first time we see Superman in action it is an amalgam of things we've seen before. The flight rescue sequence is a combination of two scenes from the original movie. The rescue of Lois and the helicopter and Air force One. The scene in the new movie is so uninspired it lacks any excitement.It's derivative, unoriginal and pedestrian. Just like everything else about this movie.Lois Lane is one of the problems in the movie. She has a Pulitzer Prize now, still smokes and has managed to retain the looks of a collage age Supermodel. Scenes with Clark and Superman are routine and lack chemistry.Making her a damsel in distress in 2006 is just another example of how the filmmakers just don't seem to care about the characters and story. There is no character development at all. Not that it would make any difference with the hollow ones that We are given. Brandon Routh is doing an impression of Christopher Reeve. This is not acting. It is caricature. It's Shallow…but not his fault since he is following Singer's direction.Lex Luthor is back as the villain, for the fourth time. His big plan this time is near copy of his first plan. It's all about Land. Again. Spacey's Lex is no more dangerous or threatening than Hackman's and he feels like he's imitating also.Parkey Posey's Kitty Character. Just a facsimile of Eve Teschmacher from the original movie.Luthor has speechless henchman. One with a tattoo on the back of his head. It looks silly, not scary.There are so many references to the first movie that it starts becoming less of an homage and begins to feel more like a retread. And like a retreaded tire. This movie flies apart and heads in various directions.It is a choppy and disjointed mess. On All levels. The story as well as the editing. Poor pacing impedes The movie throughout. Not that there is much of a story to hinder.This movie offers nothing new at all. It says nothing new at all. What can you say when the best dialog was written nearly 30 years ago.The flying scenes. Another fraud. Superman just zips back and forth on screen like a blur or is shown as a spec on the screen. He becomes insignificant.The savior subplot. It isn't intelligent or involving. It's dishonest and inane. The ""big"" surprise in the story can be seem a mile away. Superman seen in a hospital? Just plain bad.The gaps in the story continuity and logic throughout is enough to give any intelligent viewer cause to To roll their eyes. Lois Lane's award winning article is ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman"" She seems to have hatred toward him in some scenes. Yet the password on her computer is… ""Superman"" If you don't want him in your head then why would you want to have a daily reminder of him? The viewer should feel Betrayed. Something of which Singer has a very bad habit of.First leaving the ""X-Men"" series and then making this drivel. It goes to show that sometimes when the budget is as extraordinarily high as it was on this movie and all creativity and originality disappear.They think we the audience are vulgar and stupid. Why else would they pander to us?Bryan Singer has fallen prey to the machine of Hollywood. No longer caring for the story , characters and certainly not the audience.Instead, he and everyone else involved with this sham has become like Lex. Only interested in his cut.He and his cohorts should be tried, found guilty and banished for all eternity in the Phantom Zone.It won't be Luthor or Kryptonite that does Superman in. It will be word of Mouth and Captain Jack.",19,23,mv28115,"Jun 28, 2006",

9,Why the movies need Superman . . .,"He gives us a character to Believe in. He supplies our imagination with a hint of what IS possible. On the giant screen, we all WANT to SEE him DO the impossible. AND you know what, he is so damned easy to root for.In this age of Sinicism and scrutiny in the movies we watch, Superman Returns delivers the goods, period. Brian Singer assembled this compelling story sequence-by-sequence, edit-by-edit. Spiderman 2 is the only other comic book motion picture to come close to suspending my disbelief along with being thoroughly entertaining. Plug in all the clichés that exist. The film is respectful of previous films, the comic books, and even to past actors that have played characters on film and television. And then, there's Brandon Routh. Imagine the pressure placed on his being, to not only play three characters, but also be CONVINCING as ""the Man of Steel"". Routh's and the Almighty Kevin Spacey's performances nearly made me forget, at times, the astonishing special effects, the length of the movie AND criticisms I have read on which actors should be playing which characters. You know what, What Ever. Whether you are a casual moviegoer, an avid fan of comic books and Superman, or a motion picture mutant, Superman Returns is THE definitive Superhero movie.

The opening action scene with the plane was enough to have earned the price of admission. This version showed a more human side of Superman. It was nice to see him in his human element as well as his superhero alter-ego.Visual effects were stunning. I hope this franchise will continue!

10,"Jon Monsarrat review: I was skeptical, but then! Fantastic!","I'm not much of a comic book guy. The X-Men movies have all been a victim of their own ego. The Spiderman movies had too much special effects. I loved the original Superman movie -- but I was a kid. When I saw it Superman 2 recently as an adult, it's really corny.So I was prepared for an unbelievably cheesy Superman movie. I couldn't have been more surprised. Every time there is an opportunity for a melodramatic moment (think E.T., the alien dies not once but twice), or a corny moment (think Indiana Jones 2 when the overly cute and annoying kid saves Indiana Jones -- twice)... the film was understated instead. Yes, somebody finally made a movie in which the kid is not annoying.As a result, all the natural power of the Superman mythos, which is part personal power fantasy and part New Age God Metaphor, is not dragged down and is allowed to, well, fly! In addition, the ending was superb. Superman does not steal the glory entirely -- non-super humans get to help out, too. The special effects are spectacular without dominating the movie. Kevin Spacey, as usual, is fantastic.The only criticism I might make is that they didn't throw out some of the Superman story that's aging (Why does Lex Luther hang around with idiots as henchmen? Why should Kryptonite affect Superman?). And the doomsday scenario they invent is original but does not translate well onto the big screen.However, they do add a few original twists on the old story. Clark Kent's idiotic costume (his glasses) is questioned, we see a little of Superman's father, and the theme of how Superman impacts society and gives us hope and a moral compass is explored. That theme by the way, is still relevant even though Superman is fiction. I feel inspired and you should see this film, too.Who should see this movie:-- Everyone, and do it nowI'll give Superman a not-quite-perfect 9 out of 10.",0,4,johnnymonsarrat,"Jun 28, 2006",
8,Don't listen to the naysayers,"To start off, I'm going to state that I'm not the hugest Superman fan and haven't read all of the comics. I'd also say that most viewers aren't familiar with the most intricate details of Superman's life, therefore aren't going to nitpick at minor details.I've been reading some of the comments that people have left this movie and most of them are extremely negative. People have been going so low as giving this movie a 2 out 10... NO WAY! If these people were so dissatisfied with the film and they're giving it a 2 out of 10, I'm wondering why they even stayed for the whole showing.THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE! All of these naysayers have been nitpicking with every single detail of the movie when there are a lot of positives. For one, the effects in this movie are fantastic and it's worth seeing this movie just for that. Second, people keep comparing Brandon Routh's performance to that of Christopher Reeves which is also a mistake. I admit that Brandon Routh is no Reeves, but that doesn't mean he gave a terrible performance. Spacey also does a fantastic job playing Lex Luthor and brings charisma and charm to the character. There are certain parts that are just drawn out to long lengths but look past this and appreciate the other parts of the film.

5,Superman Returns,"The Superman addicts who have seen every other movie, and know everything about Superman will take more away from this movie then those who don't.First of all, the movie was two and a half hours or so.....In my eyes, the movie was really boring for the first hour....I was thinking of walking out, but since I didn't pay to get in, I said what ever, I'll stay and watch. Eventually the movie picked up and when there were action parts it was a very good movie, but when there wasn't, it was really boring.The plot was a little weird.....I'm assuming the movie was supposed to revolve around Lex Luther trying to build islands out of crystals, but they only followed that for about thirty minutes of the movie. The rest of it was just Superman wandering around saving random people or it was boring character development.The acting was....rusty. They chose a good actor to play the roll of Superman, but there was really no emotion put into the movie by any of the actors. There were no emotional parts so there was no need to have to be a good actor. At times, when people are talking, you can't understand what they're saying which gets annoying after a while.The special effects were alright. The opening, where they do like 10 minutes of wandering through space of special effects were not the greatest I have seen. At times the special effects looked awkward....But other times they were quite well done.Overall, this was an alright movie but it definitely did not live up to the expectations I was expecting for this movie.

10,Awesome!,"First of all the proper title of the film I am reviewing is Superman Returns: An IMAX 3D Experience. I can sum up my experience in one word, WOW! What an awesome, awesome movie. The visuals were top-notch and this was by far the most crystal-clear theatrical film I have ever seen. I can only assume that this IMAX film was filmed and projected in High Definition. The 3D aspect of the film was limited to about 4 or 5 scenes, but were very, very cool and were spaced out enough that they did not distract from the overall film.Brandon Routh emulates Superman, and in many ways Christopher Reeve as well. Having grown up watching all 4 original Superman movies in the theater I went into this one with guarded optimism and was rewarded with a fresh new look at a classic Superhero. I was pleasantly surprised over and over during the film when plot twists and dialogue actually went different directions than I expected and kept me guessing. Kate Bosworth puts in a good turn as a much more likable Lois Lane. While I loved the original films I always thought that Margot Kidder was kind of a hag and could not see what Superman would see in her. Kate Bosworth is a real beauty and did a great job of picking up where the other films left off while re-inventing Lois Lane a bit for us. James Marsden plays her new love interest, and does a commendable job as well, but I could not help thinking, ""Hey isn't he Cyclops from X-men?"", and ""Hey you can't mix DC and Marvel Comics characters!"". Kevin Spacey also makes a surprisingly excellent Lex Luthor.Overall I was blown away by this film both visually and emotionally. I actually got choked up after Superman's first big rescue at the start of the film and several of the 3D scenes had me on the edge of my seat. This was Awesome. Hats off to Bryan Singer for another great job. See it, and if you can, see it an IMAX theater, it is definitely worth the extra admission price. I would suggest seeing a later show to cut down on the little kid audience factor as my viewing would have been even better without all the toddlers talking, crying and walking the aisles during the movie.",1,2,themoviebuff71,"Jun 28, 2006",

5,Long Winded,"It's not that the movie did not follow the story from the comics or even the series Smallville. It's just well, it was really not that good of a movie. Bosworth acted well, but she is no comic book heroin. She is to waif like and petite to be one. You cannot act curvaceous and voluptuous. Just bad casting on Singer's part nothing more nothing less. Routh looked more like Ken Whal from 80's show Wiseguy then he did Christopher Reeve and the only reason I make a comparison reference to Reeve's is because Singer's main reason for picking him for the role was because of his supposed look-alike appearance to him. Routh is under-whelming as Supe's but yet not bad as Clark. I guess it's because Clark plays more into the wimpy look he naturally has. Tom Welling probably would have done a better Superman but not as good a Clark. However the movie is called ""Superman Returns"" not ""Clark, Welcome Back"". Again just bad casting on Singer's part. The plot was ver similar to the the first movie (78). With Lex's evil vixen played tremendously well by Parker Posey eventually doing something similar to what Miss Teschmacher did in the first movie. Singer I feel is just extremely over-rated as a director. The only reason his X-men movies did so well in the theaters was because of the huge fan base the X-men have. People saw the first movie and were like ""oh, uhm"" and then saw the second hoping only to see if he did right. Both decent movies, but not extraordinary. Neither one of those movies can hold a candle to ""X-Men The Last Stand"" the only one not directed by him.The visual effects of the movie however were worth the price of admission. So I recommend it based on the strength of the visuals. Overall however just another super hero movie that will be forgotten about by next year when Spiderman 3 comes out. Sam Raimi rules.

10,Excellent ride,"You know, if someone would have asked me before i saw this movie, ""Are you going to see it?"" I would have definitely said no. I was a big fan of the Christopher Reeve movies and really had hoped they would have left Superman alone. However, it seems the director really knew that the fans would not want to see a remake; Rather, they would want to see what they had once seen before. Superman, larger than life, living out a new adventure. I was really happy it wasn't a remake and that there are some things that are nostalgic, which just adds to the movies greatness. And these characters do a really good job being who they are suppose to be, not trying to act like the old ones did. All the characters did a super job with their characters, and the special affects were just so awesome. You just really felt that you were with Superman the whole time. So if your worried about seeing the movie, don't be. it was worth the money, and the two and a half hours. You wont be disappointed.",1,2,Memmah,"Jun 28, 2006",

Spacey was, well, he wasn't nearly as menacing as he could have been. Bosworth... she was so average in this film and Lois Lane needs to be anything but average.However the big let down here I believe was the script. And sorry to say, the directing and editing. There was too much time spent that really wasn't interesting, nothing magical. I didn't get that feeling of excitement or even that I watched a good story being told. It seemed a bit drug on. They would show you a segment, then segway to something else with out giving you anything to be excited about withing what you just watched.The only good thing the two writers did was X-Men II and it shows. I'm surprised Singer, with all of his talent, didn't bring us something more exciting. Even the plot was lacking majorly. And as far as Brandon (Superman), I believe he can do a good job with this however he needs to be a 'bit' more quirky when playing Clark, and a bit more emotional when playing Superman.In my opinion, this was a much anticipated film with inferior writing, directing and acting that leaves you, well me anyway, with no magical chemistry at all.

Go with the open mind of the type of film your going to watch, you'll enjoy it a lot more. Trust me :) By the way - for an action movie this ain't half bad and the best movie critics know that not every film is meant to have the same output.Thanks to some of you out there who managed to comment on this film enough to give the correct impression.Enjoy the movie, i did",1,2,stevedarby02,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Very Well Done,"Very entertaining. Good pace to the movie. All the super tasks seemed well thought out and not completely outrageous from a scientific point of view. When he is lifting something, he just doesn't take off with it, he does a gradual lift slowing increasing speed so as not to break what he is trying to lift. Nice twists to the movie near the end. I did have a small issue with some of the scenes as Superman -- his face almost was like a well-done cgi graphic as apposed to being really him. Though based on the making documentary I saw, it was supposed to be really him in the film. Just heavy make-up I suppose.Can't wait for the next one.",0,1,bayerjv,"Jun 28, 2006",

8,Everything a hero movie should be,"After seeing this movie last night I am left with the warm fuzzy glow of having been thoroughly entertained, which to be honest is a feeling thats been lacking lately in my movie watching. Superman Returns has everything a good solid super-hero movie should have. A terrific hero (good job Brandon), a wonderfully nasty villain (yay (once again) Kevin) and a tough,no nonsense heroine (nicely done Kate), all thrown together in one kick-ass, well scripted, beautifully shot, nicely paced, exciting, touching,funny epic movie. Bryan Singer is no stranger to making awesome movies, and it's nice to see that he is yet to peak. His movie has an underlying sense of love and respect for all things Superman, without limiting it's appeal to Cape Wearing Middle-aged men and their sons.I love movies and I love escapism and this movie had it all. Great job!!",0,1,eileen-rita,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Excellent and well worth the wait,"I would first like to say that anyone who complains about the homage that Mr. Singer made to the original film, simply doesn't understand the movie industry or the millions of Superman fans out there.Second. This movie was the best I have seen in a long while. The way it started with the introductions made tears come into my eyes thinking of the first time I saw the original film in a drive-in movie almost 30 years ago. I like the new twist that they put on this Superman. Coming from a comic book purist, this is a serious accomplishment. I hope that we can get this same creative team together again to see what else they can give us. I was worried that the choice of Kate Bosworth was bad for the part of Lois Lane, but I was even proved wrong on that. I am very pleased to have this new film added to the Superman Legacy!",1,2,chad-261,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Superman Returns all my Expectations,"The movie delivers pure entertainment. Brandon Rouths portrayal Of the Man of Steel was everything and more of what I expected. He took where Christopher Reeve(RIP) left off and made it his own. If people think he was similar to Reeve, that is because Reeve himself was right on cue for what the Ideal Superman should be. Routh is also on Cue with a little variance in attitude; and rightly so since we have evolve as a society since the late seventies. Gene Hackman was the Perfect Lex as the greatest criminal mind of our time,but out time being then has passed. Kevin Spacey blew me away and is now the greatest criminal mind of of his time. Kate Bosworth turned in a fantastic performance as Lois and Sam Huntington shutterly stoled all of his scenes.as Jimmy Olsen. James Marsden is always great, but was superb as the new character Richard White. Frank Langella fits the image of Perry White but didn't get enough screen time to strut his stuff. All in all it was the best movie I have seen in my adult life. The only con I can think of which really isn't a con is that they should have kept us dangling a little more on the idea of a SuperSon. I can't wait for the sequel, but I hope its not churned out too quickly, they need to take their time with the big daddy of all the super hero/comic book movie franchises.",1,2,stephencue,"Jun 28, 2006",
,Very Disappointed in Superman Returns,"I have to say I was very disappointed by this movie. It wasn't much of an action movie after the first sequence with the plane. As for drama or emotion, saying ""Good night Lois"" twice is about as emotonal as he gets (but if you're good at reading faces, you'll like it more perhaps. Also, Superman really needed someone to actually fight, to show that he can do more than lift heavy objects.Finally, after seeing the trailer for Spiderman 3, I must say that this trailer was better than the entire Superman film, I mean really! Sam (Raimi) can you please just do all comic book movies? Sam seems to be the only one who has got it (it takes more than just being a film maker). I wish he could have done Fantastic Four, X-men, X2, etc....",1,1,vergie_flyingsolo,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Wow.,"all i have got to say is wow. this movie was completely unbelievable. i enjoyed it the whole way through and love how it started out like the original with the opening credits. i will admit, i'm a fan of christopher reeve and i went seeing this with the intentions of having his shoes, or well boots to be left unfilled successfully; i was wrong. i found myself during the opening theme trying to hold a few tears back because to me, christopher reeve will ALWAYS be superman. brandon routh did an excellent job though and i was totally amazed by his performance. i found myself at many times finding myself thinking i was watching christopher reeve on screen, his similarities, mannerisms, hell even the way he looks and talks was almost dead on at some points, it was down right scary.the whole story developed well, though i would like to of had it last longer, it kept me on my seat the whole time and didn't bore me like other superhero movies (spiderman 2). with the blend of lois, and everyone else involved it was great. kate bosworth was an excellent lois lane, and of course, kevin spacey was a much better lex luthor in my opinion. he just has something about him that made him more believable and sinister towards superman.the inclusion of marlon brando footage was great and a flashback scene at the beginning was nice. the ending though which i won't spoil definitely made me go 'wow'. i can't think of any better movie i've seen in recent years than this. bar none, superman returns is the movie of the summer and the year.",1,2,dalvenjah931,"Jun 28, 2006",
7,Outstanding!,"A whole new take on Superman! From start to finish this film delivers all the goods that we've dreamed of seeing from a Superman film. Bryan Singer's take on the iconic character is different from the films of the late 70's and early 80's where Superman is portrayed as a boyscout who always has the answers and never doubts himself. This time around we see a Superman struggling to find his place in a society that has been without him for several years. Stunning visual effects, good writing, and great performances from Kevin Spacey and Brandon Routh make this film a must see. There has been a lot of questions about the casting of Superman, and even his new suit--those worries are quickly put to rest the first time Superman makes his appearance on screen. The archival addition of Marlon Brando as Jor-el ties the entire film together and helps those who aren't familiar with the mythology of Superman.",1,2,ThomasCohan,"Jun 28, 2006",
7,superman returns; faithful to it's predecssors,"Being a huge superman fan for the most part of my life, i've read most of the comics and seen all the movies and TV. series. But you don't have to be a big superman fan to enjoy this movie. Superman Returns dosen't waste any time recaping the origin story we all already know. It basically picks up where superman II left off, but you'll have no problem following the storyline. My only complaints, are that it is a little too similar (both in style and storyline) to the older superman films. I did enjoy the shots were superman is in space, they were incredible (similar to some of the superman artwork of Alex Ross).

Even if you are not a fan of superhero movies or superman, you should absolutely watch it. It will definitely change your mind. It might start off slowly, but it becomes fast-paced and chock-full of suspense and action. It also includes romance and comedy. I give this movie a ten out of ten.

10,Superman Returns with the best film in a long time,"From the strains of John Williams' music as we again here Jor-El and see Krypton explode to Williams' score playing as the credits roll and the dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeve, ""Superman Returns"" is easily the most inspirational and moving film in years.I found myself caring for and concerned about Superman from the beginning; I had to repeat to myself ""it's a movie, just a movie"" whenever Luthor put one of his heinous plots into motion.And whenever something catastrophic happened to Superman, I had to say to myself ""There's going to be a sequel."" To avoid from making a spectacle of myself.The way people talk about seeing Star Wars in the theater for the first time in 1977, with admiration and nostalgia--like it filled a void that they never knew existed--that's how I felt at the end of Superman Returns.Bryan Singer, I can say, got the formula right in a way that Richard Lester never did. For Richard Donner and now Bryan Singer, the movie is about the triangle of Clark (now Richard), Superman, and Lois. The action is only filler.",1,2,RobareTiger,"Jun 28, 2006",

The story plot is fabulous and much more in depth than any of the other superhero action flicks. Quite honestly it blows the others out of the water. I personally was head over heels for Batman Begins when that movie came out last year, and I doubted that any type of action hero movie could top that one. However, I find myself changing opinions with the release of this Superman movie. After seeing this movie (although hard for me to say) I believe this is the MOVIE of THE SUMMER, if not the MOVIE of THE YEAR. I recommend all to go and see this. It is MUCH MORE than just an action movie. Take your dates, take your children, take your parents, take anyone to go see this because it will not disappoint.

That said, I would still rush to an IMAX 3-d screening because of some truly awesome action sequences..and an amazing title sequence. This is just as disappointing as Brian Singer's first XMEN film. He has made a fine film, but the story is pretty lousy..and we are forced into many scenes that are literally echos from the first film..that's boring (ooo there's another Superman flying with Lois Lane scene). Also boring is Lex Luther's scheme..(wont ruin, but it's just unengaged. After witnessing the Brilliance of Batman Begins, Superman just feels stupid, tired, and lazy. That's not to say that there wasn't a lot of hard work put into this baby, but if your going to get comic book silly, at least give us something for Superman to battle. Performances are fine..Spacey isn't nearly as good as Hackman.oh and the runaway car scene was atrocious (placed oddly, confusing for the sake of a later joke..)",1,1,eleven11films,"Jun 28, 2006",

8,overall quite good / could have been super,"this superman movie is handled nicely. the acting is above average and the same could be said of its writing. overall direction by bryan singer? great. cinematography? perfect: the lighting, color tone, choices in perspective. a few goofy/cheese moments, but they come with the territory.how could it have been more super? the first half of the movie wonderfully establishes emotional conflicts between Superman and Lois. Without specifying these details, let's just say that they have some things to work out. These things--well, they really make the movie and our hero tick.So, the last half of the film carries much more tension related to action. and i love action. there is nothing better than well-staged suspense, but somehow the promise of conflict between lois and superman, between duty, truth, and family -- well, it's present, but passably.there is a wrap-up scene at the end that answers what i'm talking about but it is so brief and to me -- unsatisfying -- that you wonder how a two and a half-hour movie could not better complete its heart and soul.Constructive Criticism: it's silly offering this, because the piece is finished, but i will do this anyway like the workshops i've done to demonstrate that i am thinking positively about the film's deficiencies.the main problem is that superman doesn't make many choices about lois lane. he makes plenty about saving the world, which is good, because it's in his job description, but if he needs to grow, if one popular criticism of superman is that he's flawless, here's a chance where he can be more human. in love, people can act selfishly or be more self-centered. he does not. you see small moments of jealousy, yeah, but not any scenes entirely guided by it. in ""smallville,"" clark is a bit more selfish and hormonally impulsive. he gets jealous and he does silly teenage things without thinking sometimes. superman doesn't have to do this; he's grown up now. i realize the admirable trait about superman is that he's quite selfless, but nobody's perfect and when we're in love, we question those imperfections. all i'm asking for is a better dramatic and cinematic expression of the tough love between lois and superman. it's great that she's nearly married and has a son; they got this part right. now this needs to played up more so he has to work harder.the bottom line: i enjoyed it. with the promise of depth in the beginning, i expected maturation by the end of a long movie. i know they're going to use it as groundwork for the sequel, but still, i hoped for more resonance.-- a fan of superheroes, liffeyride",,,Liffeyride,"Jun 28, 2006",
1,Awful,"Throughout the whole movie superman runs around with his tongue hanging out of his mouth for Lois Lane. He Saves the day for about 20 minuets of the movie. This movie ruined superman for another generation. I would not have even had my name associated with this movie, even as a costume designer. I do not think I will ever see a future superman movie. Since seeing this movie I am going to boycott anything superman from know on. This movie is the second on my list of worst movies I have ever seen. The only Film worse than superman returns was crocodile Dundee three. This movie does not deserve the genres of action. It is purely the definition of ""Chick-Flick"". Superman returns is not even worth watching on Television. As my conclusion, this movie was Awflu.",,,terski,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Superman Returns with a bang!,"I was fortunate to see Superman Returns on Tuesday in an advanced screening at the IMAX theatre at Jordan's Furniture. Although only a few scenes were in actual IMAX 3-D, the overall effect was awe-inspiring. The film was an amazing experience and lived up to it's first two predecessors while avoiding all of the mistakes of Superman 3 and 4. The story picks up approximately 5 years after the Superman series left off. The only real problem with this is that presuming Superman 1-4 took place in the late 70's, five years later would put the time frame of this film in the 80's but the movie clearly take place in present day (made obvious by the technology present in the film, i.e. computers, cell phones, palm pilots). A mild error, but a forgivable one. Anyways, Superman returns home after a five year journey to the remains of Krypton. Once home he once again becomes Clark Kent and returns to work and soon thereafter reclaims his post as The Man of Steel. Brandon Routhe does a great job as Kent/Superman and Kevin Spacey gave a fabulous performance as the great Lex Luthor. The visuals are eye-popping, the acting and story are solid and this one is sure to be a hit. See it now!!!",,,jonnycrush,"Jun 28, 2006",

10,Sweet movie,"I'm a big fan of superheroes in general, and grew up watching the cartoons. When it comes to the movies, I set my expectations high for this type of movie.I was thoroughly disappointed in X-Men 3 because the first two were so good. I loved the Spiderman movies and Batman Begins. After the X-Men 3 flop, and after reading some reviews on this Superman, I was a little scared about how it might turn out.Turns out I had nothing to worry about. This movie was awesome. It had great action and special effects, a solid story, a very convincing villain in Lex Luthor, and some comic relief to keep it from getting too serious. It did all this and in my opinion was still able to capture the classic Superman feel that we all saw in the original movies.Two thumbs up. I would buy this movie.",,,lbarrowes,"Jun 28, 2006",

I have been a Superman fan since seeing the original two way back when I was little, (lets just say 3 and 4 never existed) and thought that there would only ever be the one Superman - Christopher Reeve. Without dishonoring Christopher at all, this new Superman - Brandon Routh, does an amazing job. In some instances it's like watching Reeve all over again but then it goes back to Routh. I think Bryan Singer has done an amazing job with the character of Superman.I laughed, I cried and when it was over I walked out with a huge smile on my face!! I think most people will be happy with this interpretation, even if you are not a Superman fan -go and see it, it's a really top movie.

4,Don't hold your breath!,"I have to say, I was looking forward to seeing the movie for while after i got hooked on toSmallville(Which is the best representation of Superman on TV or Film, and yes better than the original movie). I also have to say before i review this film, that I was not a big fan of the Richard Donner film. Yes it definitely had some classic moments, one of which is the speech from Jor-el to Kar-el, but it also had some really bad moments, like Lex Luther and his stupid way of stealing nuclear weapons(sorry gene hackmen, your Lex Luther sucked).Based on those comments, Superman Retuns is good,but not great.This movie had so much potential, but it seemed they were too afraid to out due Richard Donner's persumed Classic,Superman The movie. I was fine with Superman leaving Earth for 5 years, but when he came back, a lot of things should of changed since his passing, but the only thing that moved on was Lois Lane having a kid with another guy. It would of been nice to see how the world has moved on as well. If they stress that a little more and Kar-el trying to find place in the world, you would of cared more him like he was a orphan.As for the Casting of Superman, Brandon Routh does a pretty good job as Superman, but his Clark kent is little off. Clack Kent in the Original movie was one of the best parts of the movie because it was so funny to see the Man of steel being a bumbling idiot. As for Kate Bosworth, She actually did a better job than I expected. I thought initially she was too young for the role, but she actually hold her own in the movie. The only problem was that she lacks the spunkiness of Maggort Kidder. I have to mention this, but I was very disappointed to see what they did with Kal Penn's Character. He didn't even have a line in the movie, he seemed more like a extra than actual character. What a waste of good talent. The person who stole the show was Kevin Spacey. He actually makes Lex Luther sadistic, unlike Gene Hackmen, who portrayed Lex Luther like some cartoon character. As for directing and story, this I say is what hinders the movie from being a classic on its own. Bryan Singer spends way to much time paying homage to the original film instead of making it his own. I must say Bryan Singer storytelling ability is becoming weaker by the day. He needs to do a low-budget drama before doing the next superman movie, because in a lot ways it seemed like Michael Bay was directing this movie. As for the story, it spends way too much time on how Lex Luther scheming his way to make his own country(literally) than dwelling into the character of Superman, seeing how he is trying to find his purpose on his adoptive home.Also if your expecting breath taking Action Sequences don't hold your breath, their are not so many, and when you do see them, it seems like you have seen better(Spider-man 2 ring a bell). I think Bryan Singer and his writers should use Batman Begins as a point of reference instead of the Original Superman Movie.",,,logan_nalliah,"Jun 28, 2006",

GO SPIDERMAN. Spiderman movies are way more intriguing and than retarded superman movies. These movies make my stomach go bad. SUPERMAN can go f*** Lex Luthor. SPIDERMAN 3 is gonna be the best movie in the world.

Second, the speed of the film was just right for me. There was a lot to be said and explained, so you can't really be upset over that. As for staying true to the pass Superman movies, it certainly was. Brandon Routh did a terrific job adding his own twist on the Man of Steel , while keeping a little of Christopher Reeves personality in it as well.

BUT, if you look at it from the point of view that these are characters from a MOVIE (NOT a comic book), than you will love this movie. From the moment the credits roll, you will be transported back to the Christopher Reeve flicks of old. In my honest opinion, it does a very good job keeping the tone of the movies alive. There are subtle hints and dialog back to the events of some of those movies in fact. Routh was very good. Not PERFECT, but this is his first flight in the tights. Spacey I thought was perfect casting, and the same went for Bosworth. I've read numerous complaints about her in the movie, and they seem to all be unfounded.The film is beautiful. You could tell Singer had the love for this movie. Don't worry, I haven't forgot the special effects. The F/X in this movie are some of the best I have seen in years.

8,Better than I thought it would be,"Here is the short review. I hated the first fifteen minutes. The opening credits go on forever and the music sounds straight out of star wars. Then the dialog and film cuts are too choppy to get anything going.This changes completely with the first major rescue scene. At that moment the movie changes into a very exciting movie that only drags a little in places.I went with my wife and kids and we all enjoyed it. The special effects go up to the level where the CGI is not very obvious. There is also a love story angle like in the first Spiderman. While Lex Luthor talks some bad stuff there is very little violence.In my opinion, men, women and children will all go for this movie and it will be a giant hit.My only peeve is that the movie is to PC and omits the words ""...and the American Way.""

We couldn't contain our amazement and excitement. Spin-tingling moments abounded. I laughed and cheered, and felt my emotions rise as Superman took to the sky. Honestly, there isn't much I can say about this film that you won't read somewhere else, and if you have seen the movie you really don't need to read reviews. If you haven't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to check it out. Movies like this don't get made very often.

8,Superman Returns somewhat low-key,"I was one of those who was wishing this movie was an absolute stinker. Actually, the movie is good. Not very good, not great, but good nonetheless. Brandon Routh really shines in this movie. Not because he is Superman, but because he truly took the opportunity that was given to him and did his absolute best. The boy can act pretty well, and although he may not be the greatest actor in the world, he did the job and, in my opinion, did it well. Kevin Spacey does the best that Kevin Spacey can do, so he didn't particularly dazzle me, nor the other actors/actresses. The special effects are not spectacular, but are still very good. The way they portrayed Superman flying was excellent. The truly visualized the way it should be, I think. The movie overall concentrates on a heartfelt, sentimental storyline, however, it stumbles here and there when dealing with certain issues that are presented in such an artificial manner that really didn't convince me. Although, I must agree with someone who wrote that seeing how humble and giving Superman is portrayed in this movie brings a tear to the eye and wishes there was somebody that good in real life (and had the great super powers, as well). Although, sometimes I felt they were portraying him as if he were Jesus Christ(Don't worry Christians, it's not as blasphemous as it sounds.) Worth seeing, but don't expect to see the best Superman movie ever.",,,sandletting_go,"Jun 28, 2006",

8,overall quite good / could have been super,"this superman movie is handled nicely. the acting is above average and the same could be said of its writing. overall direction by bryan singer? great. cinematography? perfect: the lighting, color tone, choices in perspective. a few goofy/cheese moments, but they come with the territory.how could it have been more super? the first half of the movie wonderfully establishes emotional conflicts between Superman and Lois. Without specifying these details, let's just say that they have some things to work out. These things--well, they really make the movie and our hero tick.So, the last half of the film carries much more tension related to action. and i love action. there is nothing better than well-staged suspense, but somehow the promise of conflict between lois and superman, between duty, truth, and family -- well, it's present, but passably.there is a wrap-up scene at the end that answers what i'm talking about but it is so brief and to me -- unsatisfying -- that you wonder how a two and a half-hour movie could not better complete its heart and soul.Constructive Criticism: it's silly offering this, because the piece is finished, but i will do this anyway like the workshops i've done to demonstrate that i am thinking positively about the film's deficiencies.the main problem is that superman doesn't make many choices about lois lane. he makes plenty about saving the world, which is good, because it's in his job description, but if he needs to grow, if one popular criticism of superman is that he's flawless, here's a chance where he can be more human. in love, people can act selfishly or be more self-centered. he does not. you see small moments of jealousy, yeah, but not any scenes entirely guided by it. in ""smallville,"" clark is a bit more selfish and hormonally impulsive. he gets jealous and he does silly teenage things without thinking sometimes. superman doesn't have to do this; he's grown up now. i realize the admirable trait about superman is that he's quite selfless, but nobody's perfect and when we're in love, we question those imperfections. all i'm asking for is a better dramatic and cinematic expression of the tough love between lois and superman. it's great that she's nearly married and has a son; they got this part right. now this needs to played up more so he has to work harder.the bottom line: i enjoyed it. with the promise of depth in the beginning, i expected maturation by the end of a long movie. i know they're going to use it as groundwork for the sequel, but still, i hoped for more resonance.-- a fan of superheroes, liffeyride",0,1,Liffeyride,"Jun 28, 2006",
1,Awful,"Throughout the whole movie superman runs around with his tongue hanging out of his mouth for Lois Lane. He Saves the day for about 20 minuets of the movie. This movie ruined superman for another generation. I would not have even had my name associated with this movie, even as a costume designer. I do not think I will ever see a future superman movie. Since seeing this movie I am going to boycott anything superman from know on. This movie is the second on my list of worst movies I have ever seen. The only Film worse than superman returns was crocodile Dundee three. This movie does not deserve the genres of action. It is purely the definition of ""Chick-Flick"". Superman returns is not even worth watching on Television. As my conclusion, this movie was Awflu.",10,12,terski,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Superman Returns with a bang!,"I was fortunate to see Superman Returns on Tuesday in an advanced screening at the IMAX theatre at Jordan's Furniture. Although only a few scenes were in actual IMAX 3-D, the overall effect was awe-inspiring. The film was an amazing experience and lived up to it's first two predecessors while avoiding all of the mistakes of Superman 3 and 4. The story picks up approximately 5 years after the Superman series left off. The only real problem with this is that presuming Superman 1-4 took place in the late 70's, five years later would put the time frame of this film in the 80's but the movie clearly take place in present day (made obvious by the technology present in the film, i.e. computers, cell phones, palm pilots). A mild error, but a forgivable one. Anyways, Superman returns home after a five year journey to the remains of Krypton. Once home he once again becomes Clark Kent and returns to work and soon thereafter reclaims his post as The Man of Steel. Brandon Routhe does a great job as Kent/Superman and Kevin Spacey gave a fabulous performance as the great Lex Luthor. The visuals are eye-popping, the acting and story are solid and this one is sure to be a hit. See it now!!!",0,1,jonnycrush,"Jun 28, 2006",

10,Sweet movie,"I'm a big fan of superheroes in general, and grew up watching the cartoons. When it comes to the movies, I set my expectations high for this type of movie.I was thoroughly disappointed in X-Men 3 because the first two were so good. I loved the Spiderman movies and Batman Begins. After the X-Men 3 flop, and after reading some reviews on this Superman, I was a little scared about how it might turn out.Turns out I had nothing to worry about. This movie was awesome. It had great action and special effects, a solid story, a very convincing villain in Lex Luthor, and some comic relief to keep it from getting too serious. It did all this and in my opinion was still able to capture the classic Superman feel that we all saw in the original movies.Two thumbs up. I would buy this movie.",1,2,lbarrowes,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Well worth the wait,"I was a little dubious about this release, what with all the hype. I was expecting to walk out of the movie after wards disappointed. How wrong was I?!! All I have to say is WOW. I really think this is one of the better movies that has come along in some time. I have been a Superman fan since seeing the original two way back when I was little, (lets just say 3 and 4 never existed) and thought that there would only ever be the one Superman - Christopher Reeve. Without dishonoring Christopher at all, this new Superman - Brandon Routh, does an amazing job. In some instances it's like watching Reeve all over again but then it goes back to Routh. I think Bryan Singer has done an amazing job with the character of Superman.I laughed, I cried and when it was over I walked out with a huge smile on my face!! I think most people will be happy with this interpretation, even if you are not a Superman fan -go and see it, it's a really top movie.

4,Don't hold your breath!,"I have to say, I was looking forward to seeing the movie for while after i got hooked on toSmallville(Which is the best representation of Superman on TV or Film, and yes better than the original movie). I also have to say before i review this film, that I was not a big fan of the Richard Donner film. Yes it definitely had some classic moments, one of which is the speech from Jor-el to Kar-el, but it also had some really bad moments, like Lex Luther and his stupid way of stealing nuclear weapons(sorry gene hackmen, your Lex Luther sucked).Based on those comments, Superman Retuns is good,but not great.This movie had so much potential, but it seemed they were too afraid to out due Richard Donner's persumed Classic,Superman The movie. I was fine with Superman leaving Earth for 5 years, but when he came back, a lot of things should of changed since his passing, but the only thing that moved on was Lois Lane having a kid with another guy. It would of been nice to see how the world has moved on as well. If they stress that a little more and Kar-el trying to find place in the world, you would of cared more him like he was a orphan.As for the Casting of Superman, Brandon Routh does a pretty good job as Superman, but his Clark kent is little off. Clack Kent in the Original movie was one of the best parts of the movie because it was so funny to see the Man of steel being a bumbling idiot. As for Kate Bosworth, She actually did a better job than I expected. I thought initially she was too young for the role, but she actually hold her own in the movie. The only problem was that she lacks the spunkiness of Maggort Kidder. I have to mention this, but I was very disappointed to see what they did with Kal Penn's Character. He didn't even have a line in the movie, he seemed more like a extra than actual character. What a waste of good talent. The person who stole the show was Kevin Spacey. He actually makes Lex Luther sadistic, unlike Gene Hackmen, who portrayed Lex Luther like some cartoon character. As for directing and story, this I say is what hinders the movie from being a classic on its own. Bryan Singer spends way to much time paying homage to the original film instead of making it his own. I must say Bryan Singer storytelling ability is becoming weaker by the day. He needs to do a low-budget drama before doing the next superman movie, because in a lot ways it seemed like Michael Bay was directing this movie. As for the story, it spends way too much time on how Lex Luther scheming his way to make his own country(literally) than dwelling into the character of Superman, seeing how he is trying to find his purpose on his adoptive home.Also if your expecting breath taking Action Sequences don't hold your breath, their are not so many, and when you do see them, it seems like you have seen better(Spider-man 2 ring a bell). I think Bryan Singer and his writers should use Batman Begins as a point of reference instead of the Original Superman Movie.",7,14,logan_nalliah,"Jun 28, 2006",
1,no summary,"this movie made me cry. it was so awful i almost sharted. i think superman in this movie was a bit gay. i know he kisses Lois lane, but i think he really is thinking about Lex Luthor. i absolutely hated this movie and will not support it no matter what. GO SPIDERMAN. Spiderman movies are way more intriguing and than retarded superman movies. These movies make my stomach go bad. SUPERMAN can go f*** Lex Luthor. SPIDERMAN 3 is gonna be the best movie in the world.

10,A Super Movie,"""Superman Returns"" is a terrific movie.It has great action and the CGI is amazing. It kept me wanting more at the end.I've heard people say "" It's too long and they weren't true to the other Superman movies"" and "" It didn't pass Star Wars for highest opening on a Wed, so it's a flop"".First off , it doesn't have to beat ""Star Wars"" to be a hit. Second, the speed of the film was just right for me. There was a lot to be said and explained, so you can't really be upset over that. As for staying true to the pass Superman movies, it certainly was. Brandon Routh did a terrific job adding his own twist on the Man of Steel , while keeping a little of Christopher Reeves personality in it as well. I think""Superman Returns"" is one of the greatest superhero movies in film history. I find it an equal match to the first two Superman movies.",1,2,peachy_starr,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Superman has indeed Returned...,"Look. If you're a die hard Superman fan from birth. One who has followed him for years through every trial and tribulation. (And yes, I even mean the crappy electric blue Superman in the comics.) Then guess what? You probably won't dig this movie. BUT, if you look at it from the point of view that these are characters from a MOVIE (NOT a comic book), than you will love this movie. From the moment the credits roll, you will be transported back to the Christopher Reeve flicks of old. In my honest opinion, it does a very good job keeping the tone of the movies alive. There are subtle hints and dialog back to the events of some of those movies in fact. Routh was very good. Not PERFECT, but this is his first flight in the tights. Spacey I thought was perfect casting, and the same went for Bosworth. I've read numerous complaints about her in the movie, and they seem to all be unfounded.The film is beautiful. You could tell Singer had the love for this movie. Don't worry, I haven't forgot the special effects. The F/X in this movie are some of the best I have seen in years.

8,Better than I thought it would be,"Here is the short review. I hated the first fifteen minutes. The opening credits go on forever and the music sounds straight out of star wars. Then the dialog and film cuts are too choppy to get anything going.This changes completely with the first major rescue scene. At that moment the movie changes into a very exciting movie that only drags a little in places.I went with my wife and kids and we all enjoyed it. The special effects go up to the level where the CGI is not very obvious. There is also a love story angle like in the first Spiderman. While Lex Luthor talks some bad stuff there is very little violence.In my opinion, men, women and children will all go for this movie and it will be a giant hit.My only peeve is that the movie is to PC and omits the words ""...and the American Way.""

We couldn't contain our amazement and excitement. Spin-tingling moments abounded. I laughed and cheered, and felt my emotions rise as Superman took to the sky. Honestly, there isn't much I can say about this film that you won't read somewhere else, and if you have seen the movie you really don't need to read reviews. If you haven't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to check it out. Movies like this don't get made very often.

8,Superman Returns somewhat low-key,"I was one of those who was wishing this movie was an absolute stinker. Actually, the movie is good. Not very good, not great, but good nonetheless. Brandon Routh really shines in this movie. Not because he is Superman, but because he truly took the opportunity that was given to him and did his absolute best. The boy can act pretty well, and although he may not be the greatest actor in the world, he did the job and, in my opinion, did it well. Kevin Spacey does the best that Kevin Spacey can do, so he didn't particularly dazzle me, nor the other actors/actresses. The special effects are not spectacular, but are still very good. The way they portrayed Superman flying was excellent. The truly visualized the way it should be, I think. The movie overall concentrates on a heartfelt, sentimental storyline, however, it stumbles here and there when dealing with certain issues that are presented in such an artificial manner that really didn't convince me. Although, I must agree with someone who wrote that seeing how humble and giving Superman is portrayed in this movie brings a tear to the eye and wishes there was somebody that good in real life (and had the great super powers, as well).

9,Too Busy To Make A Great Film,"Bryan Singer like many directors was trying to do too much with this movie while still doing other endeavors as well. Like King Kong, Superman Returns suffers from not enough attention to the big picture and too much attention to every little detail. Though this may seem like an odd observation it is true that if a movie has so much frame by frame because the director was putting too much intellect on little things he forgets that 2 hours and thirty minutes can become quite uncomfortable. Take a look at Family Guy. Great show. But it was much better when Seth McFarlane had all his time to devote to it rather than having American Dad to worry about as well. Bottom Line, Singer should have left his super schedule to superheroes and made the movie we all know he should have made!",0,1,jigsta212,"Jun 28, 2006",
2,The Difference between Superman and other super heroes...,"Superman has always been a patriotic symbol. Truth, Justice, the American way, and all of that lovely stuff. For a long time I have never been impressed with Superman to much, because, well, he was to perfect and the tights were dorky. Sure Spider-Man wears tights, but its somewhat for a reason (needing flexibility to move and to cover his identity), and the suit for spidey is also actually kinda cool because of its design. Other super heroes Usually wear armor or some kinda of leather vests (Batman, X-Men). This Superman movie once again proves that the Man of Steel is also the the Dork of Steel. But costumes aside, lets get to why I really dislike this movie... Brandon Routh, wooden acting. It made me think that maybe the suit was to tight in certain places with as lame and stolid his lines were. When he was acting well, he seemed sad-sack and depressed. Kate Bosworth. Not just not a Lois Lane type. What great movies made her fit for this role anyway? Same goes for Brandon Routh on that subject. The kid: Another clichéd annoying little kid character twit who stands around looking at people giving them the stink eye and saying things like ""Superman will save us, you're mean Lex Luthor!"" (He didn't actually say that, its just an example of the way he acted.. Talk about someone who deserves to be b****slapped. Kevin Spacey- while having a few moments with the Luthor character that entertained me, I wasn't to impressed. (He had a much better villain character in another of Bryan Singer's movies that was actually good (The Usual Suspects). While I usually like Singer's movies (X-Men and X2 were incredible I thought, same as The Usual Suspects) I am afraid the bullet this movie will take at the box office will be one that won't be bouncing off of Superman's chest. Sure it may make 200 million, but does a guy with those kinds of tights, and the reviews of such mediocre acting really going to appeal with middle America movie goers? Especially with rumors going about that Superman's sexuality in the movie is questionable (I didn't think he was gay like the rumors said, but still). Come on, despite the whole push for so-called tolerance and diversity for gay people, the fact is most of family movie going Americans will avoid movies that may subject their children to that ideal (even though the rumors I personally found untrue). Its not a crime to try and avoid it, its just traditionalism. Along with Superman being a crappy movie, plus the whole tights thing and the rumors, I expect this movie to barely break even despite the 20 million start. But maybe I'll be wrong. My prediction though, either way, is that Pirates will ""ransack, pillage, and plunder"" all of Superman's movie goers to the different side of the cinema. Pirates 2 not only had a great first movie/prequel, but was a surprise hit (It would've been even bigger there was more advertising and critics actually realizing what a good movie is). My expectations: Superman finishes at most 270 million Pirates - A lot more.",6,6,knuckles1225,"Jun 28, 2006",
4,A two and a half hour introduction to the sequel.,"Most people loved the old Superman movies. I'm one of them. But why, after I've seen 4 of them already, Brian Singer thinks I'd want to see a 5th, is beyond me.Superman Returns is just what the title implies. A return to cheesy plots and one-dimensional characters; which may be charming in a decades old flick, but certainly isn't the case in a modern film. I'm sorry, but dressing everyone in clothes from the fifties and making them say 'swell' does not make me feel warm and fuzzy inside.All things considered, it isn't a terrible movie. The acting is passable (all criticism for the acting should, I believe, go to the director, because it is his vision of a corny archetype that they all portray), the special effects are entertaining, but unfortunately the script plays like a first draft.It isn't until the movie is practically over that one realises, 'hey! nothing happened in this movie.' There is no development, no climax, and no resolution. It is a 2 and a half hour introduction to the sequel.And, as a final rant, fans of the 'real' Superman of the comic world will be the most disappointed of all. Give this one a wide berth if you're a true Superman fan, because Singer wants to add to the Superman Mythos when he has neither the talent nor the credentials to do so. Please, movie makers, leave the development of comic characters to the people who have been writing them for years. We don't want your input.",2,3,mr_travers,"Jun 28, 2006",

Superman Returns is a beautifully shot, superbly designed, smartly written, wonderfully performed and masterfully directed masterpiece of epic film-making. This movie gets it right on all levels for me. It treats Superman with the reverence and respect the character deserves, it got the romance between Lois and Superman, the nerdiness of Clark, the evil and fun of Lex Luthor- everything is spot on.

I really tried to keep my expectations low, as good press can really ruin a movie for me as I am expecting so much. Kevin Spacey made a great Lex Luther, and Brandon Routh was well suited for Superman, IMHO..I think Bryan Singer did a great job, as I like most of his movies, and gave the fans what they wanted.

Brandon Ruth, hits the quarky subtleties of Clark Kent on the head every chance he gets and shifts to Superman naturally and powerfully. What a performance. Singer new what he had to do with this, and although he had to leave us on Xmen, it most certainly shows he put everything he had into Superman Returns. Kate Bosworth delivers an outstanding performance as Lois Lane. Lois' character plays heavily off of the main plot and Bosworth and Ruth manage to create a love story for the Ages.

6,"Better than expected, but still disappointing...","I once was a huge fan of the Superman comics. Having said that, I was eagerly awaiting this movie.Thankfully this movie was a good 2 and a half hours of Superman goodness. Once again we get to see the man in tights do his usual stuff and the action scenes are fantastic, one in particular which I will not mention was amazing. The re-creation of Smallville was absolutely brilliant and flawless. Although, Martha got almost no screen time and his father was apparently dead? What the...? His parents in the comics play a huge part and are a joy which sadly lacked in this film. Sigh...The acting was fantastic despite me believing it to be poorly casted judging by the trailers. Kevin Spacey in particular was a standout as always. Perhaps though, I do think that Rachel McAdams would have been the ideal Lois Lane. Speaking of Lois Lane, she was one of my main annoyances with this film. They should have called it 'Lois Lane' instead of Superman because she seemed to get a lot more screen time than he did! When he was on screen though, it was fantastic. The sequences were amazing but sadly few and far between. Sure we needed a good story, but having a new Superman film made with todays special effects, we wanted to see what Brian Singer could do with the endless amount of possibilities for action sequences. This failed to deliver. Big time. The story was to a fan such as myself, extremely random. I didn't want to see this whole Lois with a kid plot which I didn't think worked at all due to both the leads having no chemistry with each other. Comparing this to Spiderman 2 for example, the chemistry was so good that they produced one of the best kissing sequences ever put on film whilst maintaining a huge adrenaline ride. In comparison, Superman was rather boring. Furthermore, unlike X-Men or Batman Begins, the evil scheme given to Lex Luthor to take over the world was rather weak especially considering how many good plots they could have pulled out of the comics.The best part of this film would have to be Brandon Routh's portrayal of Clark Kent which he pulls off extremely well. All the geekiness of Clark Kent shines and we see the character we have all known to love...In a nutshell, for a film that cost so much to make, it sure didn't seem like it cost that much. Where was all the action? We want to see Superman pull off amazing feats and save the planet, not cry with Lois.",7,10,ozfalcon,"Jun 28, 2006",
8,Up to Expectations!,"I viewed this film with much in trepidation after III and IV were so lame, and the hype around this film has been huge! I didn't think it could live up to everything it was supposed to be, but I was wrong...From the opening credits - which established a direct link to the previous films - to the twists and turns of the plot, this movie was more than I expected at every turn. My two teen-aged daughters - who never saw any superman film before - were entranced by the guy in the long underwear from the first to the last.Overall, there were some unexpected twists and turns to turn comic fan-boy-loyalists sick, but as a continuation from the first two films over two decades ago, this movie lives up to all my expectations.Of the things I liked a great deal follow here, as well as some *SPOILERS* so don't read on unless you can deal with not being surprised at the movie.1. The opening credits were an good homage to the original film. 2. The saving of the 777 and Shuttle sequence left the previous films in the dust with what they can do today, but Superman's line about air-travel being safe made me laugh so hard my daughters were confused about what I found so funny. Having never seen the first two films, they didn't realize how close to the original the line was in delivery and context. 3. Kevin Spacy as Luthor did a great job. Not only did he manage to pick up on Gene Hackman's sociopathic quirks, but he also managed to infuse quite a bit of his own queasy charisma into the role that wasn't there before. 4. The bit about Lane's kid, ""Who is his father."" pretty much got answered here, but at the end of the film I was genuinely impressed over how the movie treated the subject. The piano bit was just enough at just the right time, and the choice to leave it at that left me happy enough. They could have easily put the kid in jammmies and a cape as well, but resisted the urge to do so. They even flirted with the whole super-powers thing to keep me chuckling throughout the movie. 5. Jimmy Olson has never been played on screen better. I always ignored JO's roles as crap, because they were, but here the actor managed to make an impression. Weather that was the script, director, actor, or all three I don't know, but it worked and for the first time I actually liked Jimmy. 6. The overall plot was typically movie-superman over comic-superman, but it worked well. I felt like this was the third installment that should have been out twenty years ago. As much as I love Richard Pryor, I'd now vote to burn all Superman III prints now. 7. The only two things that bothered me about the film were simple little things that don't hurt it much, but kept this from being a 10. A. The length of the film is overly long and parts of it could do with a little trimming. 10 minutes short of 3 hours is a bit much, even for Superman. B. The bit about the bullet to the eyeball was nice to see, but didn't really fit much, and the lack of Clark Kent hurt the story by it's not being there.I am now looking forward to the next movie (which there which is inescapable now) and my Daughters and I are off to go rent the first two films to catch them up on all that came before.",1,1,wapatterson,"Jun 28, 2006",

1,"Dosn't have the fun of Richerd Donner, or the Style of Chris Nolan","i've been hearing a lot about how this film is for Superman what Batman Begins was for Batman. let me say alligoricly that this is not true in the least. Odly enough Singer probably would have had a better film if he stuck with the X-men Franchise.the film lacks the fun or the wit of the Donner/Reeve films. in which Superman and Lois Lane had real chemistry and motivation. in this film they seemed to me to be rather bored. more concerned with looking good and being ""Solem and Brooding"" then actually living up the roles.as for it's inevitable comparisons with the fantastic Batman Begins. well Batman has always been a dark brooding figure. and that film gave it's characters depth and range. this film has it's characters spouting terrible lines and doing what the plot requires of them.as for Spacey. he lacks the Charisma and frustrated humor that Hackmen so held in his over the top performance of lex Luther. Spacey seems more vindictave and Hatefull, then smart and ""Dasterdly"". the film tries to be to dark in places it shouldn't, and creates humor in situations were it isn't requires.while Batman is a Dark, brooding, wounded figure, superman is supposed to represent all that is good and pure. two things this film is not.",5,9,grand_fun,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Awesome!!,"I've been excited about seeing Superman Returns for months and it was very worthy of all the excitement. I saw it last night and from the minute it began I was captivated. Brandon Routh is amazing in his role as Superman/Clark Kent. It was like he didn't even have to try. He simply WAS Superman. Kate Bosworth was great as Lois Lane, too. Kevin Spacey was an excellent Lex Luthor. Frank Langella, James Marsden, Parker Posey, and Sam Huntington had great supporting roles here, too. One thing I was very happy about was the fact that there were no fake-looking special effects and a bunch of obviously computer-generated shots of Superman flying. I think Superman fans are going to love this movie as much as I did. People ought to get used to Brandon Routh's face because, after this performance, I'm sure we'll be seeing him around.",1,2,queen_beet,"Jun 28, 2006",

George Reeves as well as Christopher Reeves aren't in any danger of being overshadowed by Brandon. It's downright embarrassing to watch his attempts to portray the man of steel. Child of tin, maybe. The Lois Lane casting was also abominable, with no chemistry between her and the S man. The whole story just lays there, and is most improbable, even for fantasy. It was pretty ugly watching this child director's attempts to deliver something worth watching. What a waste of an awful lot of money.

The performances of Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, and the always enchanting Parker Posey deliver exceptional performances. I'm especially excited to see where the epic tale ventures next.

3,How was this even likable?,"Come on guys, there are things we all strive for in superhero movies these days, like character development, an original story and exhilarating action sequences.This film only delivers part of one of these, and that's the action sequences. The story has got to be the worst part, and with such strong references to the events of the first movie, you'd think they watched the first one and re-wrote it.Why superman comes back with a massive asteroid, or whatever it is, practically half dead is beyond me. Why Lois doesn't greet her old friend Clark after a 5 year absence with a little more enthusiasm or just plane shock that he's there, is also confusing. She practically ignores him throughout the movie and then vents her angry feelings for superman while he's trying to set a time to catch up. Anyone else think the similarities to the original are a little too strong in the movie?1.Lois's first interaction with superman in both movies is after he saves her from a horrific aeronautical accident. The Boeing crash is basically the helicopter crash on a 200 million dollar budget.2.Superman tries to win Lois over in both movies by taking her for a night flight over the city, the balcony scene is practically the same. Only difference? Oh now she's mad at him.3.Lex Luthor's female sidekick in both movies not only betrays Lex, but has a secret crush on superman. It's basically the same character.4.Superman almost dies once again by being heavily confronted with Kryptonite and thrown into water. If superman can breath in space, why is being underwater even a problem?This entire movie feels like the re-written Donner version. Very clever by the way adding the line where Lois inquires how to spell a word for her article, similar to the original. But keep in mind that now she's the only Pulitzer Prize winner in Metropolis who doesn't use spell check.Can anyone explain to me why a group of criminals would rob a bank with a mini gun mounted on the roof? Someone tell me why Metropolis' finest continue to shoot the operator of a mini gun in JUST the bullet-proof vest, and then give him plenty of time to turn around?When the tiniest piece of the crystal is thrown into the water amidst the model town, no tiny land mass rises. Nor is there any evidence that the crystal has that kind of effect in water. Just the crack in the ground and a massive power outage. How in the world does Lex even begin to conclude that throwing an entire crystal into the ocean will raise up any land at all? Or the amount of land to the exact specifications of his ridiculous ""overlapping maps"" contraption in his office. It's pretty convenient that he has that map thing just in case he were to explain to anyone (in sequence) what would apparently happen if he were to launch a crystal into the ocean.The entire land mass (which isn't even habitable) superman lifts up is loaded with Kryptonite, at that amount it would be impossible for superman to lift that kind of weight, or himself for that matter. Kryptonite doesn't ""burn"" superman, it's makes him weaker. We all know this.How about Perry White just standing there like a fool as he watches the Daily Planet ball fall directly on him. Thanks Jimmy for even making an effort to save your boss, let alone get out of the way.Speaking of Jimmy, anyone else think it's ironic that after 5 years of working for a professional newspaper he acts as though he's completely clueless about everything?How about the ending that just drags on, and on, and on. I felt like I was watching the last minutes of Return of the King all over again.Oh and how in any universe does the son of superman have asthma? Or allergies to almost every type of food and requires multiple vitamins every day?I'm not trying to be one of those jerks who slams everyone who liked this movie, like it if you want. But my question is, why?",18,18,avanro7101,"Jun 28, 2006",
6,Superman returns (in a formulaic fashion)...,"After having recently viewed ""Batman Begins,"" I expected a great comic book movie from ""Superman Returns."" Instead, I witnessed a formulaic film with a generic script (the tag line?-- ""I'm always around""). This aggravates me because of the film's big budget and hype. To be frank, I feel let down after viewing ""Superman Returns."" With a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, ""Superman Returns"" drags (mainly because of the generic dialogue in the script). The action sequences lack ingenuity (Superman lifts a lot of heavy objects and keeps them from falling on people) and the dialogue is forced (see the tag line of the film). That being said, there are, at least, a few bright spots with the film: Bryan Singer's direction is superb, Kevin Spacey relishes in his role as the villain, and Brandon Routh fits the bill (at least he looks like Superman...). Still, I feel a bit disappointed...

10,Better than the '78 version,"This is a great movie. Although certainly an homage to the Christopher Reeve era, this edition is superior. Whereas a lot of the Reeve/Hackman Superman/Lex Luthor movie was campy and tongue in cheek (and well done nonetheless), ""Superman Returns"" is more serious, and benefits from it. Brandon Routh plays a flawless Clark/Superman, Lois is great, and so is James Marsden as Lois' significant other ""superman."" Some reviewers did not see much of a plot, but Singer & Co. do a great job of continuing Luthor's obsession without making a joke of it. We get to see and hear some of the original inspiration for the movie, including Marlon Brando. Look for Virgin Atlantic's Richard Branson in a cameo role as a Shuttle pilot.

10,Superman Returns!!!!!!! spoilers free,"After viewing the movie for the first time, I would watch this movie again and again. Fans who have seen this movie will gladly accept this movie as the real continuation to Superman: The Movie (1978) and Superman II (1980), from the awesome opening credits. MY GOD I LOVED THE OPENING CREDITS!!! to the sweet ending of what would open for a sequel hopefully. Bryan Singer was all perfect for Superman Returns, and does truly bring a comic book to life, just as he did for the X-Men movies. His experience of directing comic book movies, is what really made this movie come to life, as well as handling a good plot to what looks like is from the comics.Brandon Routh was very true to portraying Superman/Clark Kent...Even though, his face is somewhere to look like Chris, his character from Clark is just like the comics and movies combined. Brandon truly did take Clark Kent/Superman to a new level as facing challenges, as well making Superman as a symbol of hope.Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Kate's character in the movie really did impress me a lot. Her character as Lois Lane was a major departure from the comics, although I give credit for her performance to be as realistic as possible, and plus I sort of do like the idea that her character Lois Lane has a new love life and tries to move on, but she does show some feelings she has for Superman.The themes to the Superman movies are as followed: -Superman: The Movie -Power and Responsibility. -Superman II -The Choice to have Power or give it up. -Superman Returns -Emotion, Maturity, and Redemption.Even though there are fans who complain that this movie is stupid, of whom I do agree that there were some flaws of which I couldn't understand as well and a bit some confusion to what the plot was really talking about, Superman Returns is about maturity, and truly fits in with the continuation with the first two Superman movies with good ol Chris. I was glad to have seen this movie, which was way more of a satisfying sequel than Superman III (1983), and deserves it's place within the mythology.",1,3,egb5000,"Jun 28, 2006",

I went into this film expecting nothing out of the ordinary, and left the theta speechless.The special effects in this movie are amazing in the way that they are not shoved in your face, but more serve to immerse you in the world of Metropolis and Smallville, if only for 2 1/2 hours.Being already a big fan of Kevin spacey, I was quite amazed with his portrayal of Lex, and Brandon Routh proves that you don't need years of experience to put on a great show.Bryan Singer did amazing on X-Men and X2, too bad he had nothing to do with X3 (but thats another review) and once again has shown why he might just be the next Spielberg.There were just a few moments in the movie that seemed to be lacking in momentum, but all in all it is a thrilling ride for all.",0,1,yackyzachy,"Jun 28, 2006",

I know some are complaining about the reality of this or that, but it's fiction based on a comic book. Superman was everything he was supposed to be and Brandon Routh did a great job! It's very hard to live up to the standards of someone who's done it so well before you, but Routh stood up to Reeve's performance and made it his own. Although nobody will ever compare in my eyes to Gene Hackman, as Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey did a fantastic job. Kate Bosworth was believable and enjoyable as Lois Lane as well.

6,What more could be said? A class act and the best superhero movie to date,"What more could Bryan Singer have done for this movie? From the moment I stepped into the theater and heard the opening theme song, I was hooked. This movie is beyond incredible, and is definitely a movie for those who are seeking motivation searching for finding themselves. The special effects, the acting, it was all just a big chain reaction from the start. I had very high expectations because of my love for Batman Begins, and they were definitely fulfilled. Brandon Routh has a bright future ahead of him! I'm not trying to bash X-Men because I've deeply enjoyed those three films, but this movie is the Tiger Woods/Roger Federer of superhero films. Also, film director Singer hopped on board for this project instead of doing X3, so what does that tell you? You know, I really do believe when people are going through tough times or just in life in general, that they can turn to things which can help them overcome, and this movie is one of those things. Although he's from another planet, Superman is exactly like one of us in that he loves others and is passionate and caring. But most important, he's our idea of Superman, a complete bad ass! A bunch of humor and comedy in this movie as well. Kevin Spacey, who else could've done it better? I've just been very disappointed with so many people trying to bash this film saying how it's way too long and etc. I also think of what Lance Armstrong said to his critics when he won his 7th Tour De France, ""I'm sorry you all don't believe in hope and miracles."" This movie is certainly one of great faith and hope. Most of all, it's action packed and amazing!

9,Everything i hoped for,"Before i begin, i would like to state; i am a huge Superman fan.When i first heard of a new superman film in 1996 i was pumped. I had doubts about Nicolas Cage as Superman, but i was going to give him the chance to prove himself.Now over the past 10 years i have watched and listened to all the various reports, from Tim Burton to McG. When i heard what McG had planned i was expecting a disaster, then flew in Bryan Singer to save the day.I've thought his films were great from The Usual Suspects to X2. Now as a dedicated viewer of Smallville i had hoped that the series would go theatrical when it ended, continuing the great storyline of Lex and Clark knowing each other, but with Bryan Singer at the helm i had no worries.Now after seeing Superman Returns you will believe a man can fly, Superman did things in the film that only the comics and Superman: The Animated series have done. The plane rescue was jaw dropping. Now i have read and agree with some complaints about the plot and Kate Bosworth's performance. My hope for the inveitable sequel is that they amp up the action, possibly bring in characters from the comics that haven't been done on the big screen; such as Metallo or even Darkseid.With the upcoming release of the Richard Donner version of Superman II i know this year will be great for fans of Kal-El",1,1,patryan23-1,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Superman Returns In Style,"I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by Brandon Routh. After hearing he came way of a soap opera, I was skeptical. But in every way he came through, sometimes hauntingly like the late Christopher Reeve. Bryan Singer continues his brilliant work behind the camera. Kevin Spacey had to fill the shoes Gene Hackman as the evil Lex Luthor, and while he didn't do it quite as well as good old Gene (who I would have LOVED to see reprise his roll here), Spacey was very good. The jury is still on Kate Bosworth for me, but she was a definite improvement on Margot Kidder's IRRITATING Lois Lane. Nice use of Marlon Brando's extra footage from almost 30 years ago.I would give this a 8.5 out of 10 (had to round up for the scale here). Definitely go check this out.

5,"Cool effects, but I expect a Superman fight or something","I made an observation. I'm a huge fan of comic book heroes and heroes' movies. And I conclude that when Brian Singer abandon Xmen 3, Xmen 3 was better in action, effects, and plot and Superman is the same thing in plot that the old movies. I know that Superman is a sequel, but when I refer to the same thing of the old movies I say the same boring battle between Superman and Luthor. We are in 2006; the only action and cool effect that I saw in Superman Returns movie was the scene about the airplane crash. When Superman Return was announce I imagine a great battle between Superman and another villain or Luther in a robot suit or artificial science powers. But NO, it was the same fixation, in fact I thing that the Smallville series is cooler that the movie, because you can see more villain and fantasies. The act of the actors was excellent and the effect too, but the plot it was too much and lame (that's my opinion). When you see Spiderman or Batman or Daredevil or XMen's movies you know what I'm talking about. When Superman Return was announce I imagine a battle in the air like Neo and Smith in the Matrix 3.

I'm honestly more of a Batman gal myself :D Anyway, because I hadn't seen any of the previous movies I was left a bit lost. I spent most of the film trying to figure out how the good people of Metropolis couldn't figure out the Superman/Clark Kent connection. The other half of the movie was spent staring at Kate Bosworth's enormous forehead. The acting isn't bad. I was amused by both Posey and Spacey, but annoyed by Routh's Superman. As Clark Kent he adorable, as Superman he's a bit of a jerk who says stupid lines and looks smug the whole time. The twists are fairly obvious, even to me---who hasn't seen or read anything about Superman.

,It's no fun at all.  A BIG let down.,"Where to begin? The movie blows. How's that for starters? Dull and wooden.The dialogue was boring. Kal-el and Lois Lane were lifeless and weak. Bryan Singer, the director, claimed that he was making a ""chick flick"" out of this Superman movie. He missed the mark by a mile. Stalking an ex- and eavesdropping on conversations is romantic? Being brooding and distant is romantic? Not talking is romantic? Hardly. A good romance movie has a more complicated emotional structure. This was rather simple and immature.Parker Posey was miscast. Instead of Ms. Teschmacher part II, she should have been cast as Lois Lane. She had much more screen presence than the waify Kate Bosworth. Lois Lane is a very strong female and Kate was just wispy and weak. The sad thing is that Bosworth's Lane is a good reflection of the weak and ineffectual state of current mainstream news media. God, it almost makes me mad about how lame the character is presented in Returns.The plot is pretty much exactly the same as Superman (1978). Even the Lex Luthor landgrab sceme is essentially the same. The opening credits and theme suggest that it's going to be the same style of movie but it isn't. Sadly, Returns is nowhere near as interesting as the original movie that ""inspired"" it.It depresses me that I'm giving this film a lousey review. I really did want to like it because I loved the original movies. Margot Kidder as Lois Lane was awesome. Those movies were fun. Returns takes itself way too seriously and it's no fun at all. In fact, I can't even bother looking for the rumored humorous gay subtext that people were talking about before the movie's release. It's just dull.",8,9,SpanishRicky,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,He Has Returned and the torch passed burns bright!,"The Man of Steel has returned. And while the film is not perfect, as one critic put it, I felt like I was watching something epic, something that may not be fully appreciated for years down the line.A lot of people will sadly never accept changes to this character. They have a locked in view of what THEY think Superman should be. But Superman has been constantly re-envisioned over his lifetime. Imagine only one actor or performance of Hamlet. Tragedy. Bryan Singer has taken the mythology and brought it to a modern setting. Jimmy Olsen can have a beer. The Daily Planet can have computers. Some changes are more drastic, particularly a well-known spoiler about Lois and her son. But if you give the film the chance it deserves, this development could make The Man of Steel even more dynamic than before.Don't get me wrong- the film has its problems. The editing leaves the pace lagging at points and certain early scenes feel slightly out of place. But for the most part, the problems are small.Imagine being thrown into jail for 5 years. You devote your entire life to figuring out revenge- aside from the fact is you're already a little unhinged. Meet Lex Luthor 2.0. Kevin Spacey has that Hackman goofiness in Luthor, but effectively insane. Five years of waiting and fool-proofing and he is like a kid on Christmas when he finally beats Supes. There is a darker, more violent side to him that is terrifying to watch. You feel every punch and wince at every kick he lands.I wasn't initially sold on Kate Bosworth as Lois, and while she does look pretty young to have her own child, you can look past it if you allow yourself to get sucked back into the beloved Metropolis world. It was fun to see Lois actually investigate a case (rather than just see Lois sneak into a terrorist stronghold guarded by one dumb French guard) and her interaction with her son Jason is completely believable.Most importantly though...Brandon Routh. The Superman for our generation. He has the look. He has the voice. And despite what a lot of hack critics are saying, he doesn't try to do a carbon copy of Christopher Reeve. Superman needs to behave a certain way, speak a certain way, act a certain way. And Routh has it down. In particular, a moment of quiet reverence at night in a bedroom at the film's conclusion nailed down Routh's rightful place as Superman.The rest of the key performers all turned in admirable performances. Frank Langella made Perry White a different kind of editor (rather than the barking Perry White clone from Spider-man, Jameson), a softer but still driven newsman who knows how to rally the troops. James Marsden has become the go-to man for Hollywood in roles where he can't seem to completely win the girl- his Jason White is heroic and charming and you actually can see why Lois would be with him. Sam Huntington is the nerdy/cool Jimmy Olsen that fan boys have wanted to see for a while and delivers a lot of the film's best humor.As for Lois's kid...he's perfect. Innocent, cute (but not sappy), who reacts as any child would in these sorts of situations. He even delivers some really heart-wrenching moments.The special effects were superb and flight has never looked so good. I have no complaints- not one. Everything looked real. The superpowers are all there- flight, strength, speed, heat vision, freezing breath...sorry, no mind-wiping kiss or any of that though.The only performances I felt were wasted were Luthor's squad, but then, they are just muscle and sass- Lex Luthor doesn't work alone like Bat villains or Spidey villains. He's not a rogue. He has others help do his dirty work. So silent, but necessary.To set the record straight- I spoke with Bryan Singer at a speech on Christopher Reeve at Princeton last November. The man loves Superman. But this anti-American argument that I've read about. Garbage. BS. Singer told a small group of the reporters that Superman is a symbol that the entire WORLD recognizes. And it's true. Bryan told us he knew people were going to think he was going to try to make some sort of political statement. Just because ""The American Way"" is excluded from Perry White's speech after Superman returns does NOT mean that Singer is putting a jibe at the state of US affairs. He told us that this was to recognize Superman stands for truth and justice EVERYWHERE and the ideals of the world. He isn't just saving US lives.Some people have issue with Superman suddenly flying away. Logic aside (considering he went through worm holes and all kinds of sci-fi travel that can't be calculated in a realistic sense), put yourself in Superman's boots. You miss your parents. If that there is a chance your home world (and parents) may still be around and. wouldn't't't't you want to check?.Any child who has ever wondered about their real parents probably go through this. Bryan Singer would know- he was adopted too.The one big spoiler everyone is talking about? It works. It has a few flaws itself (which will likely be worked out in a sequel) but is effective. This is a side of Superman we've never seen before. And any fears of a smaller version of Superman flying around with him need to trust in the writers and the faithful director in that they hate that concept. But to see Superman in his new role, to see him recite Brando's speech about how he will be thought odd but never alone...that clinches it. Routh clinches it.

Thank you Brian Singer for making me feel like a kid again! With the way the credits rolled, and John Williams score, it sent chills down my spine! I couldn't help myself but to say INCREDIBLE at the end of the amazing picture!",1,2,drop33,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Much better than I expected.,"I figured this movie would be like other superhero movies such as Hulk and Daredevil and basically just be around for publicity. But I was wrong about Superman Returns. It's one of the best movies I've seen all year. Probably ever. I'm not one of those types who knows all about Superman, in fact, I have never seen any of the older movies but I still found this one to be approachable. I understood it quite well and from the first 10 minutes or so got the gist at what the storyline was. There were many twists in the movie that some say are very predictable but I honestly didn't see them coming. I won't give anything but I really hope they take the story even further with a sequel. If done correctly, I'm sure it would be awesome.",0,1,darthdoom30,"Jun 28, 2006",
1,Terrible,"This movie was just horrible. It's unbelievable that Brian Singer directed such a bad movie. Xmen 2 was directed by him and that was an amazing movie. House, an amazing show is directed by him. This movie does look great yes. The acting is great, the scenery and special effects are great, but the movie lacks one key ingredient all movies need, a good plot. The plot was the abyss of this movie. It dragged out forever until the very end, then something finally happened. It was all just him going around saving people from random stuff. It wasn't really laced together at all. This movie was Brian Singers downfall. He better reclaim his glory with the sequel.",6,9,Athomas90,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Superman Saves the Summer!,So far there hasn't really been a movie that stood out as a great summer movie. Until the Man of Steel returned from his 19 year absence from the silver screen. After the reinvention of the Batman series last summer I couldn't wait to see what Singer's offering of this legend would be. I won't spoil the plot for all those who haven't had the chance to see it yet but to say that it's storytelling on a grand scale much like the original movie. Singer's style for the Return of Superman is a familiar look between what he did with the xmen franchise and what Donner did with the first film. And Brandon Routh was a great choice as his performance seems to have captured the spirit of what Christopher Reeves did with the role in the 70's and 80's. To close I'd like to say it's the best time I've had at the movies so far this year and ranks with the likes of Spider-man 2 and Batman Begins. Great film-making!,0,1,dmbfan1983,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Roger Ebert Lied...Again!,"This is easily one of my favorite movies. I was stunned once again by director Bryan Singer's Directing capacities. There are some amazing moments that I will NEVER forget. The guys at DC are amazing as you can obviously tell by how amazing the movie is. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris never cease to surprise me with their talent. There is an obvious sense of humor which helps hold the movie up as they did in Batman Begins. The Acting is priceless. Kevin Spacey (Surprisingly) makes for an AMAZING Lex Luthor. Kate Bosworth is a great Lois Lane. Brandon Routh...Did his best? Kitty Kowalski did INCREDIBLE. She could easily win one an award for acting dumb. The special FX are quite incredible. With a large quantity of CGI and Greenscreen, It seems to come together very well. I was about a milimeter away from crying...I don't cry Easily.The Critics weren't too hot on it. But the movie was amazing anywayGo and see for yourself. You'll see what I'm talking about.",1,2,Paperguy007,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,nice,"Considering the crap that Hollywood puts out. This is sure to revive your faith in a small group of filmmakers that seem to know what we need out here. The script was well done. Unlike ""ebert"" I thought the chemistry worked well between the characters. They did a great job of incorporating original score and script that kind of leaves you with a sense of memorializing to C. Reeve. The story does take a huge turn that you wouldn't expect and leaves you wanting to either hate the writers or love them depending how it will pan out. Of course though, it turns out well, and leaves plenty of room to be expanded upon. The effects were great. I dug the original font layouts in the beginning titles. Nice touch. All throughout, I think great care was taken to keep this thing legit. Although it isn't like the comics exactly, it is still a great movie. It does provide options and insight into Superman's inner world of himself a bit. This film will do very well despite what the critics are saying. They obviously are not in tune with the American public and don't rely on it. The only superman fans that wont like this film are the geeks that live their lives inside fictional characters 23 out of 24 hours of the day. I'm confident they will find something to whine about. Nonetheless, a very good job all around.",0,1,GJFisher2000,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,Great summer movie!,"I enjoyed the movie very much. The opening titles.... WOW! Very nice. I left feeling as if I had seen a great movie.Tonight, I watched the original ""Superman"" on Cinemax... this movie very much follows suit in every way, but the visuals are such more better. (Amazing what 28 years of technology can do, huh?) Rather than the 2 sequels that followed the original movie, if you are watching them, I would probably want to see this one right after the original.This is not about the script or performances (and totally nit-picky) but I just wondered how the ages matched with the original actors at the time the original movie was made. Itwas interesting to learn that both actors portraying Superman were very close in age. Christopher Reeves was only a matter of months younger than Brandon Routh when each filmed his ""Superman"" movie. However, the 2 actresses portraying Lois Lane were not so close. Margot Kidder was 30 when she played Lois. Kate Bosworth was 23. So, during the 5 year absence of Superman (hope that is not a spoiler), he gained a few months (which I would expect slow aging for him as a Kryptonian), but Lois actually lost 7 years.. making her 12 years younger than she would have been if were were in real time. I know.. totally didn't matter to me... just couldn't help but look it up.I really really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it!",0,1,martyboy00,"Jun 28, 2006",
5,Too much X-Men scenery...too little heart,"Bryan Singer, get off the X-Men kick dude! What a shame that Christopher Reeve's memory wasn't honoured in a better fashion. Take one of the greatest superhero movies ever made (Superman The Movie, 1978) and turn it into a lengthy film noir with a few decent special effects (VERY few) and lots of empty time spent staring at digitized artsy vistas of crystal shards. This wasn't supposed to be a rip off of the Spiderman ""constantly searching my soul for who I am schtick"", it should have been a feel good movie that made us care about the characters and loses us in childhood charms and imagination. Instead it took a very adult turn about redemption for past hurts, the agony of choosing between our heart and head, etc. etc. Just not a very good effort. On the positive side, the new guy playing Superman did an admirable job replacing a Hollywood legend in Christopher Reeve and with a better script and directing would be a lot of fun to watch. Worth a rental but save your big screen admission for Cars!",0,1,tombstone81,"Jun 28, 2006",
10,Superman Returns is very entertaining.,"I wanted to check this movie out on IMAX theaters but couldn't get a hold of a seat. So, I went to see it on the advanced large screen at Marcus. Anyhow, this movie was very excellent. Entertaining, good looking characters, very plausible acting, excellent plot. There were some surprises in the movie that I thought was very cool. I believe this movie stepped up to the plate. I believe it was well worth going to the theaters for this. Usually, I wait for movies to come out on DVD, but for superman, it's another story. Great special effects, It was nothing like the movie ""the Hulk"". The hulk was a terrible disaster in terms of ""everything"" specifically in the special effects area, but in Superman Returns, the special effects were astonishingly great. Overall I rate this movie in terms of entertaining ten out of ten. I would go to see this movie again. :)",1,2,imohiuddin2,"Jun 28, 2006",
6,"Awesome special effects, but horrible casting","I would like to applaud the creators on the special effects they were out-standing. The over-all excitement and quality of this film deserves a 10, but then you need to take into consideration the cast and story line.I would just like to say that i thought Kevin Spacey did a terrific job as Lex. But as for the rest of the cast probably the biggest one superman himself was way off, I have always imagined superman as being more muscular and ripped but what you get is a paper doll superman that looks like he blows which ever way the wind goes. Also Louis Lane was a huge disappointment I was looking for a drop dead gorgeous girl and what you get is far from that. Also they took a risk of throwing all these no named actors in there and I'm sorry to say it didn't pay off, I thought the acting was absolutely horrible.Also the storyline and over all plot of this film was very unstructured and random. From the beginning to the very end of the film there were many holes and misunderstandings that were left unanswered.I don't recommend seeing this film in theaters but i recommend it for a lonely night at home when it comes out on DVD.",0,0,footballlacrosse,"Jun 28, 2006",

7,Fair modern addition to the Superman franchise,"Superman returns for the new millennium! And it's clear from the technology that pops up in this movie that the characters are living in the modern era. Mobile phones, faxes, PC's and text-messaging, along with the appearance of a new space shuttle test design under-score the fact that this is a new version of the old legend.And the new version has all the charm and comic book thrills of the original. Brandon Routh is great as superman - in fact he's a dead-ringer for Christopher Reeve! And Kevin Spacy is perfect as Lex Luthor. Special effects have been updated too and some of the flying scenes really are quite spectacular and entertaining. The good acting of the leads combined with the flying scenes are the high-points.Yes, it's as good as the original, but the original was never that good. And therein lies the problem. 'Super-man Returns' has taken a legend and successfully re-told it in a contemporary setting. It's good solid entertainment. But it's more a copy of a legend than artistic advance.There is the odd touch of modern magic, for instance a memorable 'bullet-time' scene. And there's the right amount of humor.But too much of the plot is simply a re-working of ideas seen in earlier Superman movies. Indeed some lines of script have been taken word-for-word from earlier movies, which is disappointing. Lux has megalomaniac visions about owning land. Superman prevents disasters and saves people. Fun but nothing new. The really intriguing premise - Superman the alien who disappeared for 5 years into space and has now come back - isn't explored at all, which is very disappointing. There is a major plot 'reveal' which does show superman in a new light but it's not enough to infuse the superman legend with much new life.All in all it's a fair modern edition to the superman legend. Here is captured the charm and thrills of the original movie, and superman has indeed returned in spirit in the form of Brandon Routh. But the film is not in itself, original. It's entertaining, without being memorable.",0,1,mjgeddes,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,I believed a man could fly!,"I went along with the hope of some escapist entertainment and I didn't expect to be moved to tears as the movie started but I was. The opening credits and music set the scene for what was to come, the re-use of the original Superman soundtrack and opening credits style raises the bar for your expectations. This is obviously a carefully crafted movie made by someone who is greatly passionate and enthused about the content, and it showed. I saw flashes of Christopher Reeve everywhere. Bryan Singer must have said to Brandon Routh ""Take the very best of what Christopher Reeve has left us and evolve it"". That is exactly how this movie feels. Brandon Routh feels very ""real"" in the role, this is not a lightweight or flaky Superman. The leading character is strong, has depth and is well structured. You will care about him and what happens to him. Frankly I'd like to meet him. If you were ever wedged in a hopeless place, he is the guy you would most want to see.Kate Bosworth does an excellent job as Lois Lane. Again, she feels real – she smokes and argues with the boss. Thankfully Bryan Singer avoided the stereotypical dumb female screaming constantly and demanding to be rescued. Somehow I could never understand how ""the man of steel"" would hang out with some whining pathetic female who was hardly capable of boiling an egg for herself. She stands her own ground and that makes her relationship with Superman seem more balanced and more believable. James Marsden also turns in a creditable performance but it seems that he could only make the briefest of appearances in a sequel.Kevin Spacey, man, I'd hate to meet that guy in a dark alley… I disliked Lex Luthor pretty much straight away, he was a career weasel in a sharp suit. I felt an overwhelming urge to prod him with stake of Kryptonite myself. Parker Posey was grit to his mill and I enjoyed the dynamic of their relationship. I have to say they have some of the best and funniest dialog, it was a joy to watch.Finally Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris did an outstanding job of the screenplay. The dialog is fast, meaningful and uncluttered. Their use of humor should be taught to other screenwriters in Hollywood, I've rarely seen it used to such good effect. I saw this movie in New Zealand and I have to say the audience enjoyed it noisily! ...but then we've waited a long time for Superman to return...…and as to Bryan Singer re-assembling his team and doing a sequel? Yes please. I'd buy a ticket to that.",1,1,liz-451,"Jun 28, 2006",
9,"may not be perfect, but overall EXCELLENT","This is a terrific movie. The action scenes truly showcase all Supes powers and are a wonder to behold. Even better, every action scene is shot with a lyrical quality that is just one positive of the amazing cinematography here. The story is surprisingly poignant and Routh gives weight and depth to his godlike character...NOBODY could be a better follow up to Reeve than this guy here. Spacey is expectedly spot-on with Lex and Kitty and Jimmy are simply natural in their supporting roles. Bosworth lacks the ""IT"" factor that Kidder had, but also lacks the lines that give her the opportunity to be the quirky, spunky, unique character of the Donner film. Still, she does a very good job in the role and there were moments where i was impressed at her acting in reaction to Rouths masterful superman. There were some elements of the film i didn't like, such as the pacing, but with a second viewing the movie as a whole proves much better. Some griped about its length, but I actually wanted more. More exposition, more dialog, more Clark+Lois, and more Supe+Lex would have made it all perfect for me. Still, the movies storyline is captivating (very hard to do with the Superman character). The conflicts are beautifully resolved and the ending will simply leave u wanting more. Singer should be hailed for the mere feat of finding such a genuine successor to Reeve, but he also manages to construct a poetic, intense, beautiful, and faithful homecoming of a move. I highly recommend and anticipate a Director's Cut DVD with some of the cut footage to aid the pacing.",0,1,yanyanman2,"Jun 28, 2006",
4,"Uninspired, boring, and drawn-out.","This movie is so boring that even writing about it is making me sleepy. Go ahead, vote my review as ""un-helpful."" I don't care. I'm going to bed. Poor acting by all except James Marsden (surprisingly enough), Parker Posey, and Brandon Routh. Spacey was acceptable, but did nothing more than reprise his role as slightly more mellowed-out Buddy Ackerman in Swimming With Sharks (a great movie, by the way). The plot was paper thin and uninspired. Lex Luthor's scheme was very lame and spartan coming from the world's ""greatest criminal mind."" The movie was plagued with family drama that seems to be supporting adultery. The sub plots went nowhere except were used as a simple device to leave the movie open to a sequel.",4,5,gomi2,"Jun 28, 2006",
1,Superman Returns but who really cares?,"Bryan's work with the first two X-Men were enough to get me out to see Superman in it's second day here in New Zealand. That and the fact that it's Superman... Being made in the era of amazing eye candy, who wouldn't wanna see it? Also I really wanted to see how they did with bringing him back and how the story would work out. Unfortunately, there's really nothing new here. They may as well of remade the original. The story is really empty. The Lois, Clarke and Superman triangle is really what the movie is about, which if you really give a darn about you can watch the Lois and Clarke series. Unfortunately, it didn't really work out so well in the end with that being the main pull. I will not throw out any spoilers but if I did I would go on for a few paragraphs about how these things didn't make the movie any better at all... Seeing as they aren't really anything new.

I know that's a mistake because with such high hopes I can only be disappointed.Well I was NOT disappointed. But I was not thrilled either. The story left me wanting more. In part, in a good way -- the way they intended, so as to set up any future sequel. But also in part in a not-so-good way.I felt the story was meandering. I prefer a good, tight story that makes the viewer feel as if strapped to a rocket hurling down the tracks to some inevitable confrontation. This story really just meandered. It could have gone anywhere, logical or not, and it did just that. I never felt that sense of ""immediacy."" But it was basically good stuff all around. They clearly put some thought into questions like, ""How can we show Superman flying in an interesting new way?"" Certain tricks like unique camera angles were used repeatedly. Even the opening credits were an homage to the original Superman movie while still being revamped and interesting.Individual scenes were good-to-great. I loved the drama of the story.

The actors weren't outstanding, but all were solid and surprisingly felt like I was watching Reeves at some points... voice or smile or something... it was a little weird, but nice (fond memories).Overall, the movie kept me interested and entertained for the majority of the time, with some laughs in there too, but it would have needed to keep my interest the WHOLE time if I were to rate higher than 7.",0,1,Ghost_Hunter,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,The best time I ever had in the cinema,"Let's put it this way, I've been waiting for a new superman movie for the last...,well forever basically. And the first time I heard that they were making superman returns I was so happy, Its hard to explain. Any way after a long anticipated wait I finally went to see it on opening night. 5 minutes in to the movie I had goosebumps with the opening credits, I just loved how they kept the original score. Being a huge superman fan I extremely enjoyed the movie, full credit to all the cast especially Routh and Spacey. Routh in some scenes made me think that he was Chris Reeve even his voice sounds similar. And spacey was great as Lex Luthor. It was just amazing for me and I really recommend it to everyone who enjoys superhero movies, and you definitely can't miss the best superhero off all of them......SUPERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S: They are definitely making sequel",1,2,gurx_316,"Jun 29, 2006",
9,The long wait is over,"I thought the film was fantastic. It truly did justice to the character as portrayed by Reeve, and carries on the legacy superbly.The actors did fantastic jobs. Routh could pass as a voice double for Reeve, and Kevin Spacey portrays criminal real-estate broker Lex Luthor with flair. Kate Bosworth did a pretty good job at single-mom Lois Lane, even if it did take me a bit to wrap my mind around the concept.Superman continues to embody the greatest virtues of humanity, even if he is not exactly human. He is one of those heroes that is always needed by society, to be a symbol for everything that is good and just. The new film brought that symbolism home, without having to shove it in the viewer's face.If you have a place in your heart for Superman, then I believe you will enjoy this film.Go out and see it, and despite the PG-13 rating, take your kids.",0,1,c_mcvey,"Jun 29, 2006",
7,It's a bird! ... It's a Plane... No it's Superman,"This film did justice to the most powerful superhero of all time. It had that comic book aura, much like spiderman and batman begins, that many comic movies fail to capture. Picking up on the story line after superman 2, 5 years later Klark timely returns to planet earth only to find that the humans he left behind are in major need of his assistance. The movie progresses to create a plot that was not subordinate to the spectacular special effects present throughout the film. Brandon Routh and Kate Browsworth both did justice to their roles and kevin spacey made for a sinister and maniac Lex Luthor. The last 30 minutes of the movie ran a little dry for my liking and over the top, predictable Hollywood style scenes threw me off a bit.

9,Superman has indeed returned,"Just to get the negative out of the way, there were some slow parts that could have been cut. Blah, blah, blah, artistic differences, etc, etc, etc.OH. MY. GAWD.Talk about a rousing return! Folks, you are in for a treat. Bryan Singer has brought that special touch of humanizing the unknown from the X-Men films to Superman Returns. NEVER has Superman been so real, so vulnerable, and at the same time so incredibly awesome. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you won't get up from your seat because you'll immediately want to watch it again.First, props on the opening title sequence. Singer does a great job of tying the old series into the new from beginning to end. You'll instantly be transported back to the 70s when you were a kid sitting in the theatre watching the opening title sequence. Make no mistake, my friend. This is a Superman movie. The sights and sounds are all so familiar that nostalgia grabs you and won't let go for the next 2 and a 1/2 hours.Next, the acting. I thought Spacey was a great cast for Luthor, and boy was I right. He has just enough star power, enjoyability, and acting talent to not only fill Gene Hackman's shoes, but to do for the role what Jack Nicholson did for the Joker in Batman. He makes Lex his own, and you love him for it. The hands down best call in the history of casting is Parker Posey as Kitty. She literally steals scenes with dead pan humor, lines from the past, and just grabs your attention as ""What will she do/say now?"" every time she is on the screen. And, yes, everything you have heard about Brandon Routh is 100% true. Not only does he do a great job in the role, he made the role who Christopher Reeve was, and there are flashes where you forget that isn't Reeve on the screen. Definitely a great tribute to an actor who will forever be remembered by those who saw the original as Superman. Kate Moss did an OK job as Lois, but audiences tend to agree they need some more strength from her character. A fantastic actress, she's no Margot Kidder. She has the stubborn thing down, but sounds more whiny when she does it, and defers to her fiancé to solve her problems instead of ripping the editor in chief herself. I know she can do a better job, she just didn't do it here. It was great to see Cyclops from X-Men playing a role here as Lois' fiancé. Carey Elwes would have also been a great choice for the role.The plot. Oh my goodness the plot. Without giving anything away in the terms of spoilers, let me just say this is the deepest plot of any superhero movie I have ever seen. There are at least two subplots going on here, which is different than having two different story lines going on at once like Singer did in X-Men. Just to fast forward through it all, our story takes place as though S3 and S4 never existed (which they shouldn't have). Superman has been gone for 5 years to see if his planet actually survived when astronomers find what they think might be Krypton. Superman returns just as he showed up the first time on the farm. After getting his old job back at the Daily Planet, tragedies begin taking place, and it's business as usual for Superman, who finds out Lois has new love interest and a son, as well as winning a PUlitzer Prize for her article, ""Why the world doesn't need Superman"" which is why you hear her say in the trailer that the world doesn't need a savior. Meanwhile, Lex is plotting and scheming Superman's demise as well as his own world domination plans. It all culminates off the coast of the US on a yacht and a surprise Lex has in store for the man of steel. Once again we pit the brains of a super villain against the strength of a superhero.Visually, this film is so good I can't even begin to describe it. The use of dark and light tones, the storms at sea, the clouds in the sky, sunsets... *gasp*. It's all so beautifully exhausting you just want to sit and watch. With something like 1,400 visual effects shots, you will be surprised how little you look at and go ""hmmm...."". While Titanic didn't hide its visual effects very well, it is the one movie that comes close to the wizardry and mastery of film-making we see here in Singer's vision of Superman Returns.Just to wrap up, this movie should so make $1billion dollars. If Titanic can do it, Superman Returns should definitely be able to duplicate that. I am not one much for repeat viewings of films, but this is one I will see at least 3-5 more times (cuz i still gotta see it in IMAX *grin*). The story just pulls you in and doesn't let go, all while Singer is reproducing a Y2K version of our childhood hero. The film is dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. Reeve, as one would expect, and I'll tell you right now, if Christopher were alive today he would have tears of joy in his eyes to tell us all that Superman has indeed returned...",1,1,deac0n_fr0st,"Jun 29, 2006",

3,What happened?,"I've been a fan of superman. He is one of my favorite comic book characters. I saw the first two X men, and really enjoyed those! Bryan Singer did a great job with him. Unfortunately, he left the trilogy(leaving Brett Ratner to destroy it) and he demolished this one.So what was good and bad? The actors did a fine job. The FX were quite stunning and good. The story was awful. I could remember countless times thinking, oh man, when is this going to end! The movie was so long, and it had to no flow. There was a basic plot and that was it. There was no was direction with the story, things just happened and then it ended. If I were to pinpoint where it went wrong, I would say the writing.I really had high hopes for this, seeing as Bryan left the X men trilogy to direct this, so I told myself, this better be good. Wow, 2 disappointing decisions. I'm sorry, but I was not impressed. But, I still have loads of respect for Bryan and his creativity. He is a brilliant director, and he just made a slight mistake.

The acting is great, the special effects are great, and the story is fantastic. For all superman fans alike, we should be rejoicing this film as Bryan Singer has done right to the superman universe. THe movie has love, action, and humor. Even though the major spoiler was a bit upsetting, it doesn't hurt the film too bad. Get ready for a sequel to tie up a lot of loose ends.So bottom line.

8,What A Great Return!!,"i was very afraid of watching this movie at first. i thought this one is gonna be one of those wannabes! but i have to thank Bryan Singer and his very creative and rather interesting way of putting things into the eye of the viewers.to make things clear, this movie isn't about superman kicking lex Luther's ass. it is much deeper, way more humane than any other movie that i have watched recently. it is more serious, but still entertaining. looks into superman in a different angle. watching this movie felt like living a day or two in superman's life.Bryan Singer's choice of the cast is genius. superman almost feels like Christopher reeve. Lois lain, beautiful, bald, and .... what can i say... a woman.... and finally, Kevin spacey... i really liked his character. he wasn't as crazy (or childish) as Gene Hackman. he was more formed and genuine.it is good that they respected the laws of physics in this movie. and i would like it even more if they have keep doing so, or may be more, in all comic-to-movie pictures.all in all; the movie is fantastic in every way. don't expect a remake of the classics. this movie leaps into a new era. a more humane, loving, and dramatic era. it is slow at times, yet it roller coaster into breath taking rides.absolutely worth watching in the cinema... may be twice! and a must must have DVD... i hope a blue ray DVD or something.",0,1,eagleknight98,"Jun 29, 2006",
7,Superman is Around!,"Initially I was a bit skeptical if 'Superman Returns,' would recreate the magic of 1978, especially after its sequels always fell a bit short.However this movie scores well on effects (which had to be expected) and what adds to the allure is a human touch that makes superman a better hero to connect with.After a break, the man in blue is back to his office as the clumsy Clark Kent while one looks forward to him converting the elevator into his changing room before he takes to the sky.Brandon Routh as the man of steel foots the bill and brings back nostalgic memories of Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacy as Lex Luther is great to watch, (as always his plots for destruction are unique and his dialogues with Kitty bring a smile) while Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane captures the frame as the ideal foil to her superhero with moments of substance exchanged between the two. After watching the movie the viewer gets the feeling that his old friend is back and tends to forgive him for his absence. The movie has its captivating moments that have one gripping the edge of the seat.Perhaps the movie could do with some slick editing at places where it drags at times and makes one look at the watch. But all said and done, it's Superman in his new avatar for the 21st century so grab the popcorn, take those few long drawn moments with a pinch of salt and enjoy our original superhero doing his breathtaking sequences as he goes about saving the world.",0,1,danzs,"Jun 29, 2006",
6,Above average at best!,"Let me start off by saying i have never been a big fan of super-hero movies, therefore you may find my opinion slightly biased. The first super-hero movie i liked at all was Spiderman, then i saw Batman Begins which completely blew my mind (constantly comparing this movie to batman begins may be another reason i didn't like it so much).I went into the movie with very high expectations: Kevin Spacey is my all time favourite actor (and was not a let down), Brian Singer was amazing with ""the usual suspects"" and i just thought the new generation of super-hero movies was something different.Kevin Spacey's acting is superb and is the high point of the movie. The rest of the acting is simply mediocre. The story is very very ordinary and predictable. The regular selfish super-villain trying to gain power while its superman's job to stop that.Anyway don't get me wrong the movie is pretty entertaining, especially the scenes with Kevin Spacey (more in the first half than the second).Conclusion: any fan of superhero movies or Kevin spacey should watch this film......otherwise you're not missing much.",1,1,nik-115,"Jun 29, 2006",

2,General Stuff about the movie- without any spoilers.,"OK, where do I start? After having seen superman 1, 2, and 3 at least 100 times, I can say that I know the Superman stories quite well. But this, was just extremely disappointing.Firstly, Who on earth decided to cast Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane? wrong move. She had absolutely nothing going for her. She was very bland,very boring, and had frizzy hair through the whole movie. I mean, couldn't they make her a little more sightly. I know that Lois Lane was never gorgeous, but it made her unlikeable, which is not how Lois Lane should be like.If you had a choice between Queen Latifa, Alexis Arquette, and Dennis Rodman, any of them could have probably done a better job of Lois, than Kate. Thats how bad she was.Secondly, Jimmy. He was cute and all, but just not like the original lovable Jimmy that we all grew to love.Thirdly, there was not enough action in this movie. The evil plot by Lex Luther was good, but did they really need to bore us for 1.5 hours before getting into it? I Don't think so.Next, What was with the line ""Good Night Lois."" Wasn't it enough that Superman only had 20 lines in the whole movie, without him having to repeat ""Good Night Lois"" (and once good night katherine) Approximately 8 times.There was Definitely not enough Superman in this movie. And I don't think they showed off Brandon as much as they could of.Unfortunately, i think the critics will be justly harsh. All in all, an OK movie, with crap casting, not enough superman or action, and boring in many parts.The upside? there was about 9 funny bits in the movie, which added a nice touch.Id give it 6 out of 10. But I Definitely wont be seeing Superman 2 at any movie theatres. I think i'll wait for it to come out on TV.",10,17,paradisediamonds,"Jun 29, 2006",
9,Screw Ebert.....Why this movie was great:,"As a character, Superman's biggest flaw is his near invincibility. Most people that do not like Superman do not like him for the fact that they feel he is too powerful. His only weakness is an extremely rare mineral that hardly anyone knows about or can get a hold of. It seems unfair. To me that was the purpose of the movie: to show that Superman is actually quite vulnerable. Despite all of his powers, he can be weak and he cannot do anything he wants. He is not a God. This is shown very well in a couple of scenes. First when he is outside Lois' house and she tells richard that she didn't love Superman. For as powerful as Superman was, there was nothing he could do. His emotions are just as delicate as the next man's. You could tell how hurt he was when he flew off into space buried that pain in trying saving the world (the thing he knows he can succeed in). This idea is shown through out the movie and struck upon again when Lois, Richard and Jason save him. After his rescue, he looks at the 3 in the plane and realizes that Richard is a good guy and there is nothing he can do to change Lois' mind. So he leaves to save the day knowing full well that he could die by trying to move the island. You could see his desperation and pain. The most powerful example is when he is getting beat up. It is a powerful scene. For the 2 previous hours all that was shown was how strong and powerful Superman was. Within minutes he was being humiliated and beaten. Pain is something foreign to Superman, but you could see him experiencing it. It was hard to watch. You could see his sudden transformation from the most powerful man ever, to an ordinary man being picked on. These scenes were executed so well. They make this movie great.",0,2,TwoThirdsMajority,"Jun 29, 2006",
9,Almost perfect...if it wasn't for Spacey,"I'm sorry to say it but Brandon IS Superman...I'm sorry Christopher Reeve but he is.Now to the movie, this movie is probably the best movie of 2006 so far. Like I said ALMOST perfect. I think that the movie will average at about 8.2 making it on the top 250 movies, and it deserves it, it's a perfect mixture of romance and action, story line and humour. I like the fact that they cast an UN-known as Superman Brandon was the best thing in this movie, followed by Kate Bosworth, she did the best performance of her life, I don't think she was Lois Lane, but she did a heck of a job at playing her.Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, your performance was below the standards of this movie, you over acted it and I didn't like you, you annoyed me and I think you should've been re-cast.Returns has the best Special Effects I've EVER SEEN I think that it will win an Oscar for Special Effects, there is a scene in the first half of the movie that was visually stunning and really believable Bryan Singer you are my new favorite director and I'm happy you left X-Men: The Last Stand for this 9/10",0,1,Revolutionary_Nate,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,very good,"really enjoyable reboot of the superman franchise. excellent portrayal of superman and all the others whilst providing a great stepping stone for any eventual sequels. a film with heart, emotion and action...check it out. brandon routh brings a little of christopher reeve to the party whilst also something new. being a sequel we couldn't have his character be a massive departure from the first two, otherwise that simply wouldn't fit. bosworth, despite fanboys rumblings, is fine as lois lane. margot kidder, also fine for the role, brought something that kate bosworth couldn't, that sass, whilst kidder could never, in my opinion be as stunning or indeed paternal as bosworth is here. great casting choice. no need talking about spacey, he is great in any role he picks up. much like morgan freeman. hopefully this makes a stack of money so we can see singer (like he did with X-MEN) really expand on the character, create and complete arcs and give us, the audience, a superman franchise to really savour and enjoy (like donner was shaping to) for generations to come.",1,2,forbidden_pie,"Jun 29, 2006",
8,"Awesome, but a little long","Overall, it was awesome. Brandon Routh is my new Superman (it was Dean Cain and Tom Welling because I've grown up watching them). He does an excellent scene at the very end of the film that will tear your heart out. Kate Bosworth's performance left a little to be desired in spots,mostly in her scenes with Perry White, but overall, it was good. Tristan Lake Treudeau, who plays Lois' son, Jason,was a real bright spot. And for those James Marsden fans who think he got totally ripped off with the X-Men movies, he's got a big part in this film and he gets to look totally heroic, which is weird considering that he's not actually the hero. And Kevin Spacey is totally spot-on, but we didn't expect any less.It did, however, go on just a bit too long. Not King Kong too long, just a little too long. A few frames could have been snipped from some of the more lingering shots and it would have been perfect.The cinematography and special effects were amazing and beautiful. I loved how they went with a very classic 30s styling for the costumes of the main characters and for the sets in general. It was a wonderful touch that sort of takes you into the world of fantasy without taking you out of reality. The styling also makes the film look as though it could be set in any time, which will let the film be relatable to audiences in the future. This is definitely a film with longevity.I'm glad Bryan Singer got to direct his dream film. That's some bad hat, Harry.",1,1,missmissa,"Jun 29, 2006",
8,Good flick,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Overall, I liked it. I might go back to see it a second time to catch some details. This movie is a continuation in the same universe as the Christopher Reeve movies, so they throw in some comments that are only understood if you saw the other movies. It had a nice plot twist. The special effects were good and there was actually some character development, something that was missing from X-men 3. I have to admit that it was slow in the beginning but held me in thrall for the rest of the movie. Lex Luthor was much more evil and diabolical in this movie. Less comic-like then how Hackman played the role in the late 70's and in the 80's movies. Kind of refreshing that. I had gotten used to the truly evilness of Lex in Smallville. Kate Bosworth actually did an awesome job. I wasn't sure about her as Lois, but she surprised me. I give the movie an 8. If I can see it a second time, then a movie is an 8 or better.

10,My review of Superman Returns,"As an expert on Superman and having a Masters degree in Cinema and Media Studies, I know a thing or two about movies AND the Man of Steel. I have never in my ENTIRE Life, seen ANYTHING quite like this movie. Brian Singer worships at the altar of Superman and this film is a PRAYER. 2 and 1/2 hours go by at super speed and I was left needing more. As the credits rolled my body shook, my heart palpitated and I had trouble breathing. It was a fantastic roller coaster ride, sex and a pasta dinner rolled into one. Superman Returns went in through my eyes and ears, reverberated around in my brain and attempted to escape through my pores. It's power still, this next morning, leaves me feeling like I am bursting at the seams. I have never had a religious epiphany where the spirit of whatever God you worship enters your body and enriches the soul. This film....well...now I know what such an epiphany feels like.

2,Superman Return to disgrace his legend,"*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Man… I finally watched Superman Return…. Ya…. Wooo hooo….Now I have to say, before I went to see the movie I was disappointed about the choice of actors… The Superman played by Brandon Routh and Lois Lane played by Kate Bosworth just did not work for me. That was before I went to see the movie… right… right…. OK after I watched the movie it still don't work for me… it's a great thing that Routh's smiles like the Late great Christopher Reeve and it's a great thing they trying to bring some of that in but I just don't think he fit as ""The Superman""… but hey thass just me… OK, the movie was so-so; nothing special it was like X-men, good movie to watch but the story is sad. There are few good scene and well one funny part and lots of cheap jocks. O and guess what Cyclops was in it haha that was funny... as I already said I really don't like the casting doesn't work with me. One thing that got me laughing all through the movie was this, Superman banged Lane and now Cyclops is banging her… but she don't seem to know if its superman's child, and if the movie continued from the last one why is that Lane don't seem to know that Clark is Superman… The movie has flaws… lots of them… one main one is that part where he lifts the Kryptonite Island and throws it into the space… what is up with that I though superman loses his power and goes weak when he is around The Kryptonite and the firkin island was full of it.The ending could have been better than what it was… my suggestion was that Superman is looking out from the space and he hears someone calling for help and as he is flying down it closes… another ending could've been when he was having the coma..haha.. just had to laugh on that one. Haha Good movie to watch but I was personally disappointed.",20,64,masspass,"Jun 29, 2006",
9,"John William's music started playing, and it just got better from there.","I know fanboys nitpicked about the size of the ""S"", and they'll probably nitpick about the way kryptonite functions differently at different points in the film (won't say which of course), but to me, it was the score that was most important to me of all the minor details (the major being the acting and story).I loved that music all my life, and it would be even stupider to leave it out since this a pretty-much sequel to Superman II. But it was there, from the opening credits (with those awesome ""3-D"" titles) from liberal peppering of the cues from John William's score. John Ottman really knew what he was doing. He didn't try to show a comparison of his work to William's. Often, I could hardly tell when one started and the other began. That was partly due to Ottman's dual role as composer and co-film editor.His goal was evidently to blend the two scores together so that they complimented each other. Only in the long cues could you tell one from the other, but even then, Ottman stayed true to the original's heart. He did compose a couple ""choir"" moments that he's become infamous for, but this time it was graceful rather than operatic, especially when Superman hovers in front of the sun's light. Just beautiful.As for rest of the film, it stayed as true to the heart of I & II as well, damn good all around. And I have to give kudos to the writers for not making Richard White simply the ""other guy"" that a lesser film would have made him (like most cliché romantic comedies).",0,1,jedi_from_the_block,"Jun 29, 2006",
6,Good - Not Great,"Effects: good, and used sparingly. The balance of CGI to filmed shots is well done. Acting: good across the board. Screenplay, feasible but confused. It acts like a continuation and a partial re-imagination at the same time. I think this is the main reason why the film is good , but not great. I felt confused. The only thing saving me from falling completely away from enjoying the film was the acting across the board ; in particular, the parts of Luthor and Superman. Now, was the story great? Not really. It smacks of 'first movie in a trilogy'; which usually I'm excited about, but I really wasn't taken somewhere new, wanting more at the end. Thats the bottom line. I wasn't overly 'impressed' by the story, it just wasn't written very well. (sorry writers**) It was good, not great. I rate movies usually in relationship to ""How much would I pay?"": Well, for this movie, it's worth paying full price to see it. Its a good movie. It is not worth seeing a second time, like I have for many 'blockbuster' films. This is not a 'blockbuster'. I will not buy it on DVD. I would recommend others see it, but I would not go with them :)",1,1,murdock-16,"Jun 29, 2006",
5,Routh is no Reeve,"Having just returned from seeing ""Superman Returns"", I feel the urge to pen this comment while the details of the film are still fresh in my mind.First off, I'd just like to say that I was disappointed. Actually, that's an understatement. I was REALLY disappointed. I'm a Superman fan. I have been ever since I was a little kid. I'd be running around with my little brother, our hair styled into the famous ""Superman curl"". But alas, my dreams have been shattered. It seems that a big Hollywood budget and fantastic special effects can't save a sloppy script. Sure, ""Superman 3"" and ""Superman 4: The Quest For Peace"" were stinkers, but Christopher Reeve made them bearable. That brings me to my second point.Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeve. He doesn't even compare. Now I know that Chris Reeve was not the first person to portray ""The Man Of Steel"", it was George Reeves, but the point I'm making here is that Chris Reeve IS Superman. There is just something about him. Something mystical, something magical that makes you believe: ""Hey, this guy can really fly. He's Superman"". I guess Reeve just had the right look, build and voice for Superman. He had a certain sincerity about him, accompanied by his beautiful blue eyes. I miss him.Brandon Routh does not even come close. I don't mean to bag him here, I'm sure he gave the role his all. But he's no Superman. I know that he is older than Chris Reeve was when he made the first Superman movie, but he still looks like a college kid. He facial structure resembles a ""pretty boy"". Also, I'm pretty sure he has brown eyes, which were digitally enhanced in the movie to make them blue. Watch it, and you can tell that they are not his natural eye colour. And another thing, I find Routh to be too tanned. It's weird, but it's just something that I noticed.The other key cast members were mediocre at best. Kate Bosworth did an okay job as Lois Lane, but Margot Kidder again did it better. I will take my hat off to Sam Huntington, who played Jimmy Olsen. He does a fantastic job, much better than Marc McClure. Also, Kevin Spacey is a great Lex Luthor. He's cold and cruel, but you just gotta love him.And so, I come to the conclusion of my review. ""Superman Returns"" is a mediocre movie at best. It will keep you entertained but it is not a great movie. Brian Singer is no Richard Donner, and Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeve. I'm sure there are those of you whole will praise this movie, but most of you will find that it will in no way compare to the original 1978 classic.",10,13,cryofry,"Jun 29, 2006",

Brandon Routh is going to be a star, big time, he didn't over act (which can be a tendency for young actors) and he was very believable as both the dorky Clark Kent and Superman, two very different roles. It is also a coming out party for Kate Bosworth, a young and talented actress, who does a wonderful job as Lois Lane. The special effects were good, but not great (there was one scene in particular that looked like a painted background from a bad 80's action flick).

7,The most epic/heartfelt SUPERMAN movie to date.,"There were a number of things that went wrong for this movie and a lot of things that went right. This film was labeled as a return for one of the greatest comic book superheroes of all-time, but this felt like a drama or romance film with little to no action sequences but I still don't think people were ready for the return of Superman. It's safe to assume that this movie is completely dedicated and inspired by the Donner universe and previous Superman films. It is a reinvention of the old films for the new audience of today. The entire movie is a little predictable for some (including myself). Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor was not as convincing as the late great Gene Hackman. And Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane felt like the wrong person was cast for the role. They brought in Brandon Routh to don the suit but it appears they were trying to get a Christopher Reeve look alike. After the classic opening credits in outerspace as soon as the first act begins, you really feel this is a different take on the Superman universe. The film itself is a perfect example of a summer movie caught in the hype, failing to deliver on all cylinders. There was too much emphasis on the backstory of Lois and Superman. There is a big surprise in the movie near the end which everyone pretty much saw coming but it really is hard to believe for die hard Superman fans. I rank this Superman movie behind Superman The Movie and Superman II. The Superman franchise really deserved a restart, i.e. Batman Begins/Incredible Hulk.",1,2,db1985,"Jun 29, 2006",
9,What are critics saying?,"Reading the reviews of half hearted critics and no concrete details of why this movie is as apparently awful as they make it out to be, I find nothing wrong with the movie at all. Maybe they lack the imagination to fill in a couple of the outlandish topics, or maybe they're just stuck in the 70's with the original Superman. Honestly, it's an amazing event. Better than X-Men, better than Spiderman, just as great as Batman Begins. Besides worrying about what actor would fit what part, and that Routh supposedly ""lacks charisma"" (Roger Ebert) take the non-charismatic actor and their supporting thespians and step aside from their predecessors for just a minute, you may just find some emotion if you look hard enough. By the time the movie ends you will have stepped out of the theatre and find that after a literal 2 hours and 45 minutes later, time flew by. Superman gives one the sense that he is actually there, it gives one a sense beyond senses that any other Superman or Superhero movie has given.

1,I wish Superman hadn't Returned,"Having been an avid movie and comic book fan since childhood, I can honestly say that this movie was far from worth watching. Though the effects were beautiful, that doesn't distract from the lackluster plot filled with plot holes and lackluster performances. Kevin Spacey played an arguably uncomfortable Lex Luthor who was just plain boring to watch. At the beginning of the screening the audience in the packed theatre exploded with the sound of hands clapping. When the movie was over, less than quarter of the audience clapped, and some of them probably just clapped because it was over. I went to the theatre to watch someone play Superman, not to watch someone play Christopher Reeves playing Superman.

6,More Super(Hu)man,"WOW... The first Superman Movie i am seeing in the theater. So went inside the hall half-an-hour before it starts, First-Day First-Show and as expected the hall was full. The movie started with John Williams original theme music from the first part and then John Ottman(original music) takes full control after that. This film is set to take place where Superman II ends. But they confuse with the time period the film is actually set against. The news paper deceit it as 70's while we have people carrying cell phones and LCD TV hanging around. This edition of superman has taken lot of twists to make it to the big screen after 2 decades. Bryan Singer, has done a commendable job, making superman more HUMAN than SUPERHUMAN. Superman (Brandon Routh) love for Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) takes the driver seat of the screenplay than fighting against Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey). Brandon looks good in the suit, but he looks too young to fill in Christopher Reeve, still manages to convince in the role. Kate was apt as Lois. Kevin Spacey was great as usual, now after the mind blowing performance from Gene Hackman it has take some like Spacey to repeat it, and he does it with ease. He was a lovable villain in the movie. The movie wanders from place to place in terms of screenplay, thought it really stretched towards the end, but then it did require such an ending to keep hopes for few more in this series. The Visual Effects are nice, and the stunts are mind blowing but too short. We actually don't get to see lot the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane.

,Weakened,"Gosh. Whether one likes this movie will be a matter of religion, I suppose. And within that choice will be the question of how cheaply your religious notions can be bought. For me, a summer movie needs to first provide sweep, spectacle, thrill. It needs to be cinematic. It needs to grab my optic nerve first, saturating it with precortex sense. Then all the other things fill that turbulent vessel. When it is a comic book-based project, there's the story and the grander cosmology. The cosmology is primary among these. It is the grander scheme of things that generates villains, threats and confusions about love. Perhaps there's some stuff about family or mentor in there. But this is mere disguise. The job of these things is to provide that visual world: first in what we see, and second in explaining (usually in words) some of the important laws about how that world works. ""King Kong"" is my ""summer"" touchstone in this, but I suppose ""Lord of the Rings"" would be a better example for most. That said, I consider this movie something of a disaster. I won't be recommending it to friends, and I will try to forget I saw it. The oddest thing is that I think it could have worked. It could have worked if they took out all the Jesus pandering. Yes, I know it works for smarmy politicians and their televangelist symbiotes, but its just not deep enough for a world. Not this way. I'll buy the other Reeves as the savior in ""Matrix,"" but this is just too glib. It could have worked if they ditched Ottman. I know Singer was pressed for time, so wanted all his buddies for expediency sake. And the idea of editing and scoring in the same imagination is so attractive... but this guy is so dull in imagination that it is a double curse to have him in the room. Williams' original score was brilliant, meaning in a shiny, brassy crisp way. This moos. It could have worked if the villains were sharp. Think of Spacey in the one really good thing Singer has done, as one possibility for Keyser Soze. Think of Parker Posey in ""House of Yes."" I still dream about that. Now look at how blunt these characters are. The genius of the comics was that there were 4 worlds. That of Krypton, always cryptic; that of the Daily Planet, our folded device where the story is in the story and everything is woven tightly; the ordinary world of Metropolis, the canvas on which the play is drawn. And there's the fourth world, the world of LL, where all the real people live. All the people with names that start with LL. These are the Sherlocks and Mycrofts and Moriatys. These are the people who push here and there and make the world change. They are demigods in a way. Spacey and Posey could do it. This business about Lois as Mother Mary? Well, that in the comic books would be different, but is the right direction. Like the dull score, and the deliberately fuzzy CGI (to save time, we are told), the LLs of this movie don't sparkle.

After the fantastic, gritty Batman Begins, I was expecting something a little meaty and poignant. What I witnessed Thursday night at the IMAX was a popcorn movie that I will forget in two or three days.I loved Brandon Routh's performance, thought Lois Lane was cute but miscast, enjoyed Spacey as a somewhat darker Lex Luthor, loved Frank Langella as Perry. All the elements were there... expensive production, excellent SFX, good cast, decent acting all around. But somehow it just doesn't hold up very well - it's all over the place with no solid center, exactly my impression with other Bryan Singer films.Lex's evil plan is pretty dumb, though it does look impressive in 3D. I didn't enjoy the messianic overtones to Superman's character as insinuated into this film. It lends Superman an arrogance and self-importance that doesn't bring likability to the character. He's also portrayed as a bit of a peeping tom, which bothered me just a little.Much like everything else I've seen directed by Bryan Singer, there is a lot of eye candy without a lot of character substance. It almost felt like a Michael Bay film, and for me it fails as an homage to the original Christopher Reeve version. While nowhere near as bad as Superman IV, it just doesn't fully capture the spirit of the original two films or the comic hero that I admire. I am leaving out Superman III because I don't really remember it all too well!Superman's Return could have been much better in the hands of a creative and capable director. Unfortunately for me, because of the apparent success of this film at the box office, I will probably be witness to more of the same in the future, hoping that the next one gets it right.",2,3,maximumhong,"Jun 29, 2006",

8,"Great movie, but...","The casting of Lois Lane was, to put it mildly, horrible. Kate Bosworth is, what, 16? And this is supposed to be five years after the last Superman? What were they thinking? It looks like Brandon Routh studied Chris Reeves and got his Superman/Clark down to a tee, but I don't think Kate Bosworth has ever seen the original Superman movies that so many of us have become endeared to. She doesn't look like a Lois Lane! There were times during the movie where I had to tell myself to get over it. Parker Posey would have made a wonderful Lois Lane, but then the age difference between her and Routh would be too noticeable.Other than that, the movie was great. The rest of the casting was great. Brandon Routh was terrific. Kevin Spacey, as always, a great performance. He gives Lex Luthor a more villainous persona, but I would imagine after all this time, Lex would be a bit frustrated at all his failures.",1,1,darbykat,"Jun 29, 2006",

9,Outstanding,"This version of the saga remained remarkably true to the original story line that was presented in the original Christopher Reeve version down to the look of the title, the John Williams theme music, Marlo Brando, repeated character lines, etc. I had just watched the original version with my son the week before and it picks up where Superman left off 5 years earlier. Would recommend doing the same. Lots of action and surprises. The thing I enjoyed most about 'Returns' is that it was more comic book, and not comical as in the original, which can be seen in how Lex Luthor is played - truly criminal with no redeeming or endearing qualities (sorry Mr. Hackman - but we know that was Richard Donner's fault anyway).",0,1,gobux87,"Jun 29, 2006",

7,Why the world needs Superman...,"The basic premise of Superman Returns is that Superman has returned from an unexplained 5-year absence to find a world that seems to be getting along fine without him, that the woman he loves has moved on and has a family, and that he is- at least in terms of any beings similar to him- completely alone. The amazing thing is, this is the least angst-filled, least melodramatic superhero film in the past 5 years or so. I think the recent trend has been to try to get audiences to empathize with their heroes more by making them more human and actually taking them seriously. Peter Parker battles some very serious demons and is in constant struggle with being Spider-man, the X-Men films are very serious and political and the latest instalment, ""The Last Stand,"" featured some startling and emotionally wrenching revelations, and Batman, well, need I go on? So, here we have Superman in the first new film in almost 20 years. He has his issues, but unlike all the other Super heroes around, he seems to be very solemn about it all. After all, he is Superman, not Clark Kent; Clark Kent is his mask. Obviously a huge nitpick people will have is that Clark comes back the very, very same day as Superman and not one single idiot in the city of Metropolis seems to notice, right? Well, yes, that bugged me too, at first. But then, the more you think about it, that's just how Clark Kent is designed: completely forgettable (except by Jimmy), always in the background, and always overshadowed by the bigger story, which is Superman. David Carradine has a very great speech about Superman at the end of Kill Bill Volume 2 that justifies everything quite nicely to me, so I suggest seeing that if you haven't already. What this movie does a great job of doing is just showing this classic, iconic super hero doing what he does best: saving the day. There's something so refreshing about finally getting that clear view of Superman for the first time after he saves a planeload of passengers from certain doom, and saying with a smile: ""Don't let this turn you off to flying, folks. Statistically it's still the safest mode of transportation."" But that brings us to the actual plot. It goes for simple, safe, repetitive— tedious, even? And, honestly, it's the kind of plot that just doesn't justify the runtime. Lex Luthor comes up with a ridiculous plan that even in the world of comic books is pretty hard to swallow. He compares himself to Prometheus, how he is so generous with the ""mortals"" by sharing his wonderful discovery, though planning on killing billions in the process. Lex obviously forgot the last half of that story, where Prometheus is punished and confined to terrible pain for all of eternity. But maybe that's the point. I mean, we all know from the very beginning Lex won't win, he's doomed to lose, that's just how it's meant to be: Superman wins and Lex loses. Written in the scriptures: is, was, ever shall be, in comic strips, TV shows, feature films, living in an ageless universe, for all eternity.Bryan Singer is obviously aware of this. Singer also directed X-Men 1&2, and I think his biggest problem as a director is that he lacks a sense of completion in his works. X-Men is not the kind of movie that you watch, and then once it's over, you want to watch it over again. It's the kind of movie that you watch, and then once it's over, you want to see the next one. The X-Men films were each done with the presumption that there would be a next instalment, and that's fine I guess if you like always being on the edge of your seat waiting for the next one, but when his Superman movie does the same thing and drags past the 2-and-a-half hour mark, there's a problem. If nothing else, the movie establishes that Superman is indeed back, and we should expect to see more of him in the future.Superman Returns is definitely a grand film. It's big, it's loud, it's expensive. I usually don't think to myself, 'hey that looks expensive,' when watching a movie, but I did in this case. It doesn't try for anything new or bold, it doesn't want to, and it's nice to see a super hero movie where the hero is the generic do-gooder, and helps mankind because he really wants to. That's why I think Superman garners more universal appeal than any others. But, honestly, the angsty heroes can be much more interesting. Certainly so with last year's Batman Begins, which I thought was a great, perfect movie, while I though Superman Returns was really good, but probably could have been better.My rating: 7.5/10",101,58,Derek237,"Jun 29, 2006",

9,The Man of Steel is back!,"The room is dark, the popcorn is in your lap. You can feel the excitement in the room. Not since the dismal Superman IV, which unfortunately was Christopher Reeve's last portrayal of the last son of Krypton, have we seen the big man on a movie screen. I was so afraid as I am sure many other people had been that my expectations were to high for this film. Lets face it, who could help fill the gap that Reeve left so long ago. Then suddenly you hear the low strings begin the legendary John Williams score and the credits start flying at you in true Superman fashion and you are off on a 2.5 hour escape from reality. The acting was amazing. Not at any point in this film did you feel like you were watching a two dimensional film about paper characters. These were real people with real problems. Kevin Spacey played Lex Luthor brilliantly. Holding back the true dark side of the character until it just comes out of nowhere and grabs you by the throat. Brandon Routh took on the personae of the American icon like it was meant to be. No discredit to him but it helped the transition that the similarities to himself and Reeve were at times uncanny. His Clark Kent was dead on. You just wanted to root for the guy. Bosworth portrayed a more jaded Lois Lane that was bitter about the five year absence of Superman and had finally gotten on with her life. Not only is she engaged but also has a child which really tends to complicate things. Along with great supporting roles by Parker Posey who I loved as Kitty and Frank Langella who brought new life to the already great role started by Jackie Cooper. This was a true experience. If any part of any adult still has in them the little kid that would wrap the towel around their neck and jump off the bed and thought they could fly if they tried just hard enough. Then they will love this film.",0,2,tghood15,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,Absolutely amazing.,"I will be the first person to admit I have an obsession with Superman. Still, after re-watching the first two installments of the classic film franchise this week in preparation for Superman Returns, I could at best describe them as tedious. They did have their high points – Christopher Reeve's flawless portrayal of strong-willed Superman and socially-awkward Clark Kent chief among them – but on the whole, the films were dated, ill-conceived, and at most times, simply ridiculous. You've seen the Family Guy send-up on the cellophane ""S"" from Superman II, right? Yet somehow, Superman Returns embraces the series' somewhat sketchy past and creates wonders with it.Updating the series to the present day without explaining how we can go from 1978 to 2006 in the span of five years was mildly annoying, but worth it upon pay-off. Seeing the 1950s style architecture of the Daily Planet infused with plasma screens and fax machines was a visual treat. I had concerns about the new Super-costume while viewing the trailers – specifically, about the suit's texture and the trademark ""S"" being too small -- but they were put to rest early on in the film. The suit looks amazing and that ""S"" is the perfect size, along with Kal-El's infamous codpiece (surely you've heard the rumours?).Brandan Routh does a brilliant job as both Clark Kent and Superman, constantly reminding viewers of Christopher Reeve, while at the same time making the role his own. While Kent is still awkward and doesn't quite fit in, he has far more humanity than in any previous film. Clark is able to show a range of emotions, primarily concerning the ramifications of his five-year absence, but still manages to maintain the air of someone who can easily be written off; someone far too meek to ever be seriously considered as Superman's alter-ego despite his identical height, weight, and piercing, chiseled, vibrant blue eyes (yeah, I've got a new crush too, sue me!).Kevin Spacey retains the campiness of Gene Hackman's original performance as Lex Luthor without making the character ridiculous. While Luthor's plan clearly will remind you of his first scheme in the original Superman (give it time, it won't for long), you actually fear his character and believe he can indeed pull it off this time around. Spacey's portrayal of Luthor in this film is a wonderful transitional piece that means by the sequel, Lex will be far more ruthless and fearsome. I can't wait.Kate Bosworth does a great job updating Lois Lane, making her transition from marriage-loathing, mortgage-fearing, commitment-phobe reporter to engaged and devoted mother-slash-reporter a believable one. She is nothing like the damsel in distress of the first films, and gets beat up quite a bit while displaying feats of tremendous personal strength.With a tremendous support cast, Superman Returns has a jackpot of action scenes, and all flying sequences are simply breath-taking. But a movie is nothing without plot, and this film is concerned with that fact more than any recent superhero film. The science and reasoning behind the main conflict in this film is nothing short of genius, and subplots only add more layers to the alread endearing characters. The little details are attended to, like how Kent can get his job back so easily at the Daily Planet. As a result, you care about these characters, their carefully orchestrated development, and will leave the theatre desperately waiting to see what is in the future for this franchise. X-who? I've stated earlier that the first two films of this franchise are tedious to rewatch, but do yourself a favour: rewatch them. The benefits in doing so will be quite apparent when you get to the theatre for this film.In closing, I believe it goes without saying: This is formal offer to become Bryan Singer's ass monkey for life if I can, in some small way, be apart of the sequel(s).I know you're reading this, Bryan. I am deadly serious.",1,2,steve-2837,"Jun 29, 2006",
8,Superman Returns...With a vengeance,"Maybe I was just the right age or that Christopher Reeves was just the right actor but, as a kid, I loved Superman! This time I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I saw no trailers or previews other than static ads so I went into the theater 'clean'.Was it perfect? No, but then again when compared to a beloved original what is? The casting was great, the writing was not over the top and the effects were amazing. I was a little disappointed in the overall look of the movie. It was a little to slick. Maybe it was just an 80's movie thing but the best part of the originals was the natural look.The number one reason to go see this movie? THE ACTING!!! Kate Bosworth(Lois) and Kevin Spacey(Lex) in particular took their roles to the edge of 'over-done' but successfully reigned them in to create improbable yet realistic characters. Moving Lois away from the original ditsy-girl image can easily be ascribed to the loss of her love and maturing/moving on with her life. Lex is more of a dramatic change but definitely one for the better. Spacey kept Lex from being a silly, demented, Batman-esquire villain instead portraying a sociopathic criminal genius.Brandon Routh(Superman) and James Marsden(Richard Whtie) were more subtle but achieved an amazing depth of emotion. Throughout the movie I was trying to figure out what was 'wrong' with Superman. Routh plays the role with an almost 'alien' distance emotionally. It helps remind us that Superman, as much as we love him, is not one of us. Which compliments the issues being dealt with in the movie perfectly.Marsden on the other hand is the most believable character in the film. At first you write him off as the storyline tie-in. Then he's the wimpy nice guy who doesn't assert himself. In the end you realize he's an average guy who, like any of us, can do great things when push comes to shove but still wants to live his life just not on the edge.All in all I liked this movie a lot. It's not an Oscar winner but it's moving and well done. Compared to the recent comic-book/superhero movies it's simply the only one on this level.",0,2,daxer585,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,Absolutely Amazing,"wow this film completely blew me out of the water! It is visually stunning and I was surprised at how good the acting was and how much heart is in this movie. Very little downside, but the movie looked very dark colored, not the subject matter, but the actual tint and color of the film its self was just really dark for some reason. Other than that, this movie rocks!! Brandon Routh has become my Superman for the new generation and I can not wait to see where they take this story in the sequel. I highly recommend you go see this film at least once and if you weren't sure if you liked it, go see it again because many people have said that it was even better the second time around.",1,2,patrickbstewart-1,"Jun 29, 2006",

3,So much money spent for so little,"As a big fan of the TV show from years ago, and one who really liked Superman I and II, I was looking forward to this version (really liked Singer and Spacey's work in ""Suspects""). What a disappointment! Where to start? Well, it was really L--O--N--G. Where are some scissors?! The dead time just ground this to a halt, repeatedly, even out of the gate.Has anybody else figured out that cool FX do not alone a good movie make (George Lucas, you listening?) And in reality, apart from the space shuttle rescue early on, there's not much else that is that cool (what, big crystals growing out of the water--WOW!) Beyond that, almost everything seemed forced, never finding any kind of balance between action and humor--probably in part because it was all but humorless! I'm still of the opinion that this type of ""Saturday matinée"" fare must have some laughs (hear that George?) After all, that was part of what made S-I and S-II (like Star Wars 1-3) so much fun, some campiness. Totally missing in this latest iteration.I could to on, but others like me will have to see for themselves, but this thing is a total clinker. Oh sure, it looks good, no expense spared, but clearly more should have been spent on the script and E-D-I-T-I-N-G!

Kevin spacey plays great as lex, and so the rest of the actors/actresses. The bottom line is, all the characters are played well. One thing I noticed though is that the movie seems to be too heavily emphasized on the story line. I mean, the story is great and all, but this is superhero movies we're talking about, and i think we should have more fun in it (ie. action). Besides this, it was a great movie and i will go again to see it.",1,2,lotusvale80,"Jun 29, 2006",
7,Held back from greatness by inexperienced screenwriters,"Routh, despite barely speaking a dozen lines in the whole movie, fits the role of Superman pretty well. He certainly looks like Superman. But he's really not given much to work with as his character, whether as Clark or Superman, is denied the possibility of exhibiting anything approaching a real emotion. Any chemistry with Kate Bosworth, so critical to the success of the Superman story, is completely absent, and it's hard for us to believe that these two ever loved each other, let alone, still do.The rest of the cast are universally underwritten, with Perry White and Jimmy Olsen being particularly weak. Spacey fails to bring any real originality to the role of Lex Luther and manages to be completely outclassed in every scene by the excellent and under-appreciated Parker Posey. The pychosexual dynamic of Louis-Richard-Superman, something that has the potential for genuine drama, is dismissed. Their child is not only a bad actor, but completely bland as a character. The dramatic potential of his parentage is again, completely wasted. And it beggars belief that the Louis Lane/Superman genepool could produce such a distinctly unattractive child. 'Superman Returns' makes the same mistake of several recent 'epics' – by placing the most dramatic and exciting scene so close to the beginning of the movie, the following two hours are a frustrating wait for an even bigger climax that never comes. Why the plunging aircraft was placed in the first act, and not the last, where it belongs, is a mystery that only the two inexperienced screenwriters can answer.The screenplay is full of such freshman flaws. Several scenes have nothing to do with the actual plot – the aforementioned aircraft of doom and the foiled bank robbery being only the most glaring examples. Such scenes exist to show off the powers of Superman, but shouldn't such scenes also service the plot?Lex Luther's plan for world domination – to produce a dead black rock of a continent in the middle of the freezing North Atlantic, the real estate of which he plans to sell for gazillions – is ludicrous. Who on earth would want to buy land on such an ugly and uninhabitable rock? The biggest question of the movie is how Lex could get so rich with such desperately poor business sense.The movie, however, is not without its successes. The action sequences are genuinely exciting, with the plunging aircraft scene one of the best ever put to film. The production design has its inspired moments, though fall back on the generic New York Art Deco aesthetic a little too often. There are more than a few beautifully composed images of Superman flying and floating around in space, and there is a genuine excitement and satisfaction to be had from the basic premise that an individual - infinitely good and humane and just, incorruptible and undefeatable – can save the world from itself. 'Superman Returns' isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it fails to live up to its potential on almost all counts and is, ultimately, a highly disappointing experience.",2,2,Rathko,"Jun 29, 2006",
1,I hated this movie with a passion,"All I can say is WHAT THE F%$@#!!!!! This movie was pure garbage! I must confess that Routh did a great job with what he had, but a combination of poor directing, slow pacing, weak story and bad casting choices for Lois and Lex made this practically unwatchable. I was literally about to fall asleep after 20 minutes, I kid you not. And what was up with that kid? I sensed early on that there was a remote chance of him being the son of superman, and I was praying to god on my hands and knees that they weren't going to go there and they did. I walked out of the theater so depressed cause I spent the last year psyched as all hell to see this movie and was counting down the days until its release. When I got home I popped in Superman The Movie on DVD and felt so much better watching my man Reeve flying over Metropolis with John Williams' score...which reminds me the score for this movie was terrible...why didn't they just hire Williams? It was disappointment after disappointment. And they didn't even explain the whole plot of him returning to Krypton; that was very interesting to me and it was barely addressed...LAME! I can understand why so many people like this...its mindless entertainment with incredible CGI effects...I mean our society is over-saturated with this and no kid nowadays could appreciate the brilliance and subtleties of the original superman movie. Oh well, thats just my opinion.",17,23,harry98998888,"Jun 29, 2006",
8,As Close to Perfection as I could Hope,"It was fantastic. From the effects, to the acting, to the plot. Some things are worth the wait, and this definitely was. You really felt for Superman all the way through. It's not easy being him, and I think this movie demonstrated that nicely. Bryan Singer has proved once again he is one of the go to directors for comic films. I was nervous beyond belief until I started seeing more and more material as the months progressed. I started to feel that Singer had the right idea. After finally seeing it last night, all of my doubts were put to rest. Bravo to the whole production crew.

Some of the lines were also re-used from the previous Superman movies, which was fine but.. couldn't they have thought of something more original? Routh was an okay superman, I felt he lacked Reeve's presence but he did a satisfactory job. I also feel there's a lack of chemistry between his character and bosworth's character. They could have developed the characters further, Lex's cronies hardly muttered any dialogue, jimmy olsen was mostly irrelevant and so was perry white. Lex's plot to take over the world was a bit simplistic. A real pity really, the movie could have been a lot better! On the other hand the CG effects were fantastic, great soundtrack and the intergalactic credits brings a tear to my eye. Overall, it's still a good movie and brings back the good ol' superman I and II days.",6,6,minimice,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,By far my favorite movie of the summer,"I should preface this review by saying I'm a big fan of the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies, but pretty much hate the other two. So the fact that this one is being made as a sequel to Superman 2 while ignoring 3 & 4 was just right up my alley.This film really gave me everything I wanted from a Superman movie, everything I'd hoped I was going to get. I thought all of the performances were great, I loved the story, I loved the fact that the action grew out of the story rather than the other way around. I can't think of anything I didn't like about the movie, to be honest. I can't fathom why so many people are giving it negative reviews.The biggest hurdle for any Superman movie is that he is so strong and so unstoppable that finding a credible threat to him, a hurdle for him to overcome, is very difficult to find and make entertaining. This film accomplishes that difficult task. It also gives a great love story, and some incredible action sequences. I haven't seen Pirates 2 yet, but this is by far my favorite movie of the summer to this point.",1,2,paulmg,"Jun 29, 2006",
4,2 thumbs down,"What a disappointment. From the opening credits, to the costumes, to the heavy dialog, to the special effects, to the plot, this movie goes out of its way to recreate nostalgia for the original superman movie series. What a stupid direction to take. I don't go to see movies to bring back the 1980s!! What were they thinking by making this new entry in the series feel like it was actually filmed in the 80s and left in the vault. There are a couple outstanding things in this movie. Kevin Spacey gives a great performance, hopefully reclaiming his reputation from the last few clunkers he's done. And Clark Kent(Brandon Routh) is well cast for his looks and charm. i wouldn't mind seeing him in another movie. However, lex's team of thugs are comical and unconvincing, having almost apelike stupidity--in one scene, one of them hides under a table when he is afraid!!!! i mean, come on. And parker poesy looks near tears from boredom in this miscast role. I find her funny in most other films, but why she was chosen for this ridiculous role makes no sense to me. Kate Bosworth isn't exactly a shining star. there are several moments in the movie where her dialog made me cringe, and more moments where it must have made the director cringe as well, and so she is left just nodding her head in response to other actors. there is no spark of romance between any of the actors. my advice is to wait a week and go see pirates of the Caribbean",2,3,j_eagles,"Jun 29, 2006",
6,Not impressed.,"I'll have to say, I was pretty unimpressed by this movie. I thought the action scenes were great, but I think they could have added another 20 minutes worth. The last half an hour just seemed to drag on and made the movie pretty anti-climatic. Although I loved seeing Lex beat the snot out of Superman, I also wish they'd feature another villain, someone who he could actually have a real fight. Another complaint I had was the choice to play Lois. Given she is very good looking, she was just way too young. This is supposed to be a later movie and she just didn't portray a mother of a toddler very well. I would still suggest this movie to anyone, because it is Superman and it was watchable, however it's probably on the low end of what I would comfortably suggest to someone to watch. The only other thing I can suggest is not to see it at an IMAX theater. The 3-D glasses were a very big distraction and I don't think it added very much to anything.",1,1,adsteve84,"Jun 29, 2006",
6,"Clichéd, repetitive, bland, onlY a few good moments","I'll write a more detailed review later with more support for my inquiries about this movie, but for now i just want to say: This movie is mediocre. IT feels like every other superhero movie, and has tons of clichés and unbelievable parts, and things that don't make sense. Its very repetitive, it seems as if more than half the scenes are the exact same things: slow building disaster with stuff rattling and people getting scared, building music as Clark Kent becomes superman, him saving everyone, then quiet, ethereal music as he descends to the ground with everyone in awe. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SEE THAT? There are many things that are stupid and unbelievable, such as one scene where superman is saving everyone form their deaths, i wondered, ""well what about the people on all the other city blocks? They're all dying right now!"" OR when two cops unload on a criminal's back, not a single bullet goes into his head or neck or arms, every single bullet lands perfectly in the robber's bulletproof vest! And then the superhero fires his huge machine gun at superman for about half a minute as superman walks towards him, the bullets bouncing off Superman's chest. How long should it take to realize that shooting him Isn't FREAKING WORKING! Only a few things stand out in this movie: Kevin Spacey, who stands out in every movie, the architecture and art direction of some sets, such as the alien, desolate krypto-continent that springs up, and the ice cave. The 2 and a half hour should have been 90 minutes. Why do they half to stretch these films that are not that deep for so long? Why is every director afraid to try something new with these movies!

9,Blew my mind!,"Alright...i'm not one of those comic book junkies but i do enjoy watching comics made into movies. I don't know if this movie was ""true"" to the comic book (most comic books made into movies aren't) but i do know that if you want to see a movie that has action, suspense, twists, and a little bit of romance then this is the movie to see. I was afraid that Brandon Routh wouldn't be able to fill the shoes left behind by Christopher Reeve but i believe that those shoes are now his! The movie was well written and directed...of course what else would you expect from the genius that is Bryan Singer? This movie ranks on my list of the top movies to see this summer. And FYI to girls who aren't interested in this kinda stuff...Brandon Routh has the sexiest voice i think i have ever heard. Brandon commands the screen and i can't wait to see him in the next Superman movie! This is definitely going to become a classic! Brandon Routh was born for the role of Superman...at least in my opinion. I urge everyone to go see it and enjoy! Trust me....it's worth the seven bucks.

I think every one (superman fan or not) should get out and see this movie, this film will turn you into a fan. I can't wait to see what his son does in the future!This was definitely better then any other super hero movie i've seen yet, better then that weak x-men 3, even better then spider man 2.

5,Not original Script,"Overall I liked the new special effects and action sequences, however, I went back and watched the original Superman and then i realized how much of the original script is in Superman Returns. It kind of disappointed me a bit. Many word for word speeches and storyline based events were near identical.I would of hoped for a Lex Luther more like the Lex Luther in Smallville, versus the original Lex Luther character. The Smallville version is more credible and realistic in many ways. The character used in the movie is, well, frankly, an idiot. I am not knocking the actors, I believe they played the roles perfectly. However the characters needed to be tweaked to be brought into realistic view in the 21st century. Yes, man flying is now credible, but not the villain. His counterparts are also complete idiots, although somewhat better than the original.The movie left room for improvement by introducing new sub plots and story lines that can be built upon in the next movie. Overall, I liked the movie, but it left me somewhat needy. Not completely satisfied.",2,3,avazquez49,"Jun 29, 2006",

The look and feel of the old superman movies has been maintained yet, the movie amazes u with the cgi wizardry and the composites and better yet , emotion. Brandon is definitely the next best thing to Christopher reeves and kudos for the perfect choice. He emotes precisely to the hilt for both the characters, Clark as well as Kal El. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is frankly better than Gene Hackman. 10 on 10 to him.The edit is superb and so is the background score. the story lacks slightly towards the end, in terms of showing superman as a superhero, but what the heck!! u don't even mind it(any ways its about his return not his heroics)...in fact i consider it an Honor to watch a superman movie to be made after my birth. Its just about everything that u wanted to see in a flick which starred your childhood hero. I got goosebumps while watching the superman entry seq. the vision shown by Bryan Singer is par excellence.

9,To those who compared it to Batman Begins...you were wrong,"I went into this movie with high expectations, despite what I had found to be rather disappointing trailers. I had heard from a friend who had seen another pre-showing of the movie that it was comparable to Batman Begins. I have to say, though, my friend was wrong. Superman Returns absolutely blew away Batman Begins. Despite the overly dramatic and under thought out evil plot conceived by Lex Luthor, the overall storyline and construction of the movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The movie had a poetry that Batman Begins lacked, and, more importantly, no Katie Homes-like love interest.Kate Bosworth played her role of Lois Lane impeccably...keeping the quirks of the former Lois Lane, namely, an inability to spell (""How many 'f's in catastrophic?""), while casting away the intense stupidity of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane.The spark between Bosworth and Routh deserves the highest praise for a movie romance...that is, it was believable.There was no over-played emotions or over-dramatized characterization, which was a relief. Given the situation Superman comes back to, it would have been easy for Routh to make his character a saggy sack of post-adolescent angst, which would make any movie of similar length intolerable.And, yes, this movie is long. It begins a little slow...but it's hard to think of something to make it much better. Beautiful cinematography, great character development, applaudable acting...definitely worth seeing again.",0,2,chamberssu,"Jun 29, 2006",

3,"Truth, Justice, and...a lame story line","Isn't Superman supposed to stand for, ""Truth, Justice, and the American Way""? I thought he was, and that is what I believed growing up as a kid. In fact, his motto greatly influenced me and my sense of patriotism as a young American. But sadly, Superman returns to earth a lesser super hero. He no longer stands for truth, justice, and the American way. No, certainly not. And the movie clearly makes this statement. Now he stands for, (and I quote), ""Truth, justice, and all that other stuff."" The film makers CANNOT bring themselves to stand firm with an American Hero. Perhaps in the next installment of this crappy movie series Superman can team up with some Islamic villains or perhaps fight for the COMMUNIST way. He could go about the world forcing each person to give according to their means, and receive according to their needs. Besides that, Superman comes off as a CREEPY STALKER. Despite the fact that Lois Lane has moved on, gotten married, had a child, and appears to be happy with her new family, Superman attempts to woo her away from that. First by spying on her inside her house, and then by taking her for a flight...in a way that her mortal husband cannot possibly measure up to. Also, Lois Lane comes off as a terrible person. She seems completely distant from her loving husband and needy child. I found myself feeling sorry for ""Cyclops"" and his son. And she is rude, abrupt, and TOTALLY self centered. If I were the Man of Steel, I believe I could EASILY find a better gal than Lois Lane. Speaking of the son, in my opinion, ""Cyclops"" is his father, not Superman. Clearly, the movie suggests that Superman is his biological father, but it takes more than that to be a dad. And ""Cyclops"" comes off as a real father figure. Then there is Lex Luthor and his LAME PLOT. He wants to grow some crystals...why? He doesn't even really know. What he ends up doing is growing some crystals so that he and his henchman have a new place to hang out and play cards. Yes, you read that right. Their big plot is to grow a gigantic crystal island and sit around and play cards. Lex had a nice house that he stole from the old lady. Could they not have just been happy playing cards down in his basement? This movie was a total let down. Also, Brandon Routh is a re-incarnation of Christopher Reeves, and not a ""New Superman."" I think Routh is a good, talented actor, but they should have cast Michael O'hearn as Superman. He would have been much better. If you ever get a chance to see a digital short movie called ""WORLD'S FINEST,"" you will see Michael O'hearn portraying both Clark Kent and Superman, and doing a great job. He looks more like the Superman I imagine. But then again, in my mind, Superman STILL stands for TRUTH, JUSTICE, AND THE American WAY.",1,2,jake-179,"Jun 29, 2006",

2,A chick flick disguised as a superhero film,"This movie was boring. There, I've said it. Now you can get angry with me. There were several great action scenes in ""Superman Returns"" but they were strung together by a sappy and slow storyline. This movie is soft -- and on more than one level. Did anyone else wonder why there seemed to be a retro-look for the movie. When I write, retro, I mean it looked like it the set and costume designs were straight from the 1940s (e.g. Lois Lane was not dressed as a woman in the late twentieth to twenty-first century). Why was this? But the softness of which I write comes into play with the way Lois appears in the film. Director Bryan Singer seemed to choose the soft focus lenses that were used on actresses back in the 1940s. Check out a film from that period and you'll know what I mean. But the word, ""soft"", can also be applied to the storyline with it's heavy focus on the romance between the intrepid reporter and the ""man of steel"". Too much tenderness for a superhero film. If you enjoyed it, great, but for the rest of you who are expecting an ""X-Men""/""Spiderman""/""Batman"" type of film, save a bundle and rent the original ""Superman"" directed by Richard Donner.

I was 3 years old when the original came out and I've never stopped being a fan. I remember this movie being talked about for almost ten years. And believe it or not.. it has been worth it. A lot of hidden tributes in the movie as well, which only true Superman fans will notice. Hat off to Bryan Singer for pulling off a very very difficult task, and Brandon Routh for filling a very big pair of red boots! Awesome movie.... absolutely awesome! The only thing that I didn't like, and I say the only thing.. was that Kate Bosworth played the part of Lois Lane. I didn't think she fit the role if you ask me. She was to clean, proper, young, beautiful and the Lois Lane we all remember was somewhat a roughneck, older, normal looking.

You really feel they are the actual characters, which is the difference between good and bad acting. The effects were stellar. It didn't look fake or anything. Tbe plot was good too. I found myself getting so emotional during certain scenes. The movie captivates you when you first meet Brandon Routh (Superman). He is the perfect Superman. Why? He actually looks like the very respected Christopher Reeves. It's uncanny really. He is also very believable. I admit I had my doubts since I never heard of Mr. Routh before. Also, my childhood favorite superhero was Superman. I never thought this movie would be able to capture all the elements of why Superman was the greatest, but it did! I just hope there is a sequel.

8,"Superman - sheesh, what more can one say?","You cannot go to this movie and think it's going to be either good or bad. You are going to be better off going only with knowledge this is a movie about Superman. Everything else falls into place.Why start a review this way? Knowing what I know about the Superman legacy and reading the other reviews tells me too much ""personal perception"" is applied.Go for the characters and the story. You will find satisfaction. Just brace yourself for some things that the average Superman fan may not expect or want to experience. But there is definitely a lot that satisfies the normal Superman fan. Love, hate, fear, comedy, drama excitement, anticipation, and even the occasional let-down.Now for my own personal perception. This was more than just excellent; more than just super! It was a great reunion with the man of steel and his friends and family - even his enemies. I loved the performances by everyone. Each character had a classic moment. You may have heard complaints about some of them but ignore the complaints. Posey had some very good comical and emotional moments although at times, her character was annoying, as I am sure it was intended. Kal Penn got his shots in, too. I think this was actually a great part for him and his career. Just getting his mug on the screen was enough to show that he does not have to stay committed to sophomoric comedy, although it appears, for now, that's all he is involved in except for Superman.OK, enough of the characters. The movie was in no way perfect. It was definitely an honor to the legacy and to the director. But I do have some misgivings which, because of the excitement of seeing ""Supes"" back in action, have no bearing against this event in anyway. The only thing is, well, heroes of any kind are never quite what we build them up to be.Being a fan of Smallville, I always have a problem with the fact that Kryptonite never seems to have the same impact on Superman/boy. As it is with the TV program, so it goes with the movie. And with that said, the only other questionable concern I had was Lex's unimaginable plot. For me, it nearly approached ""unacceptable"" for quality movie status. Still, this is the comics on screen, so it is somewhat forgivable.Well, that's enough.

9,An Excellent Return!,"I was very pleased to see the opening with Marlon Brando's voice as Jor-El, and found the irony throughout the film between father and son to be quite interesting... Also, I was glad that the movie kept to the scores of John Williams from the original theme in the Christopher Reeves movies. The opening credits indeed were very familiar to the Superman movies most fans are used to seeing, but with a touch of updated technology-- the movie throughout carried incredible special effects. Brandon Routh not just looks, talks, but also acts like the Clark Kent everyone knows. Kate Bosworth as Lois was different, but different in a positive way for the new generation. And Kevin Spacey was excellent as Lex Luther! He was a combination of Lex from ""Smallville"" and a little Gene Hackman, but with more fury. All in all, incredibly fun to watch, and very realistic for the most part (even a sonic boom in the atmosphere as Superman takes off). I feel like there should have been a little more to the story. In several parts it felt like watching the first Superman from Richard Donner. However, I would easily see this one again, over, and over!

6,"Good, but not great, revival of the franchise","As long as you're not expecting a mind-blowing, over-the-top experience, the first Superman sequel in many years is a pretty fair revival of the franchise. Brandon Routh looks and acts like he could have been cloned from Chris Reeve to play the Man of Steel, which works quite nicely for both continuity and dramatic quality. Kevin Spacey is actually an upgrade as nemesis Lex Luthor; but Kate Bosworth comes across as a relatively bland Lois Lane; Parker Posey (who clearly would have been a better choice for Lois) adds a delightful note of comic relief as Luthor's bimbo moll.The story opens five years after Supe abruptly zipped off to explore whatever remnants of his home planet, Krypton, might still exist in the universe. No one knew where he was, or if he would ever return, so the world moved on. Most notably, Lois did. When our hero shows up at the Daily Planet in his Clark Kent persona with his crush on her intact, he finds her with a son and a beau (James Marsden), who unfortunately is Perry White's nephew and a great guy in his own right. But they're not married, so hope remains for our lovelorn representative of Truth, Justice, etc. Meanwhile, Lex got out of jail and has started brewing yet another grand scheme for world domination. Killing the newly-returned Superman becomes another perk of his plot.The f/x are first-rate, including some variations on how Superman maneuvers in flight. Some of the epic-scale crises and heroics offer more in their look and sound than in the logic of the situation. Director Bryan Singer handled the first two X-Men movies (both superior to the third) nicely, and mixes in some fine elements for this adventure, including a fair number of laughs for a non-comedy. He wisely carries over John Williams' memorable score from the Reeves films, and honors the 1950s TV series many of us remember fondly with several references, and cameos for Jack Larson (Jimmy Olsen) and Noel Neill (one of two who played Lois).On the downside, there's more moping and mooning in the lengthy running time than we really needed - especially in the opening jumble of backstairs and setup; and again in the climactic battle and its aftermath. Also, Lex's latest exercise in megalomania makes even less sense than usual for such fantasies, in how he decided to use the powers he'd ever-so-evilly acquired. Perhaps he conferred with Austin Powers' Dr. Evil, when he should have consulted James Bond's Dr. No. Even with these shortcomings, I'll be ready for the promised sequel long before its likely release date.",9,8,lotekguy-1,"Jun 29, 2006",
,"'Superman Returns', to put it simply, comes up short","Superman Returns;; The plot has Superman returning to Earth after disappearing five years earlier, without any explanation. He heard that astronomers discovered what's remaining of Krypton, his home planet, and he simply wanted to go and see if it was true for himself.In doing so, he left his romance with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) out to dry. He didn't even say goodbye. Meanwhile, Lois was so upset at being dumped that she wrote an artice about why the world doesn't need Superman and won a Pulitzer for it.Meanwhile, master crook Lex Luthor has used Superman's absence to plot his criminal empire. Looking for advanced alien technology, he's even burgled our hero's Fortress of Solitude at the North Pole. There he takes crystals from Krypton, and plans to build his own continent in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which would result in the sinking of the America's. It's up to Superman to save the world, yet again.By the end of Superman, I'd realized something: Throughout the 150 minute running time, I had only about 20 minutes of fun. And for a superhero movie, that presents a big problem.With a budget of nearly 260 million, one should expect dazzling special effects, which it does, for the most part. The sequence pre-Supe's return has him rescuing a plummeting jet on which Lois is a passenger, and it's truly seamless. Also when Lex's continent grows up through the middle of a boat on which Lois and her son are aboard. It really is neat stuff. But they spent too much time of the flash and not enough on the fun.There are great superhero movies, like Batman Begins, or Spider-Man 2. There are the others on the other half of the chart, such as Elektra or The Punisher. 'Superman Returns' falls somewhere in between, off the fence of greatness, but steering clear of absurdity. I'm sure die-hard Superman fans will cherish this film, but I suppose I'm not a Superman fan.2.5 out of 4",8,8,moviesfan11,"Jun 29, 2006",
7,Could have been better! (spoilers),"As a Marvel comic book fan, I am interested in the plot and the main themes of any super hero movie that is available to watch. To me a excellent movie would stick to the plot and not jump to different subjects to make the story confusing to the viewers. The major theme of the movie to me is known as moral of the story and what it emphasizes and symbolizes through the whole movie. As a fan of the X men and X Men United, I give Bryan Singer two thumbs up for using hints or ""metaphors"" in order to extend the story. In Superman Returns there were various dialouges with Clark and Lois which really brought upon clues that would lead to the secret of Lois's child, Jason. Therefore, this signals the audience as a clue that will upbring a sequel to this movie.Therefore, the special effects and the physics used in this film didn't really made the movie seem real. I think that the computer animation and effects was the only thing that really saved the movie from being a flop. There were some parts of the film that really made Superman effects unreal and as common sense it didn't seem logical. Different times in the film Lois could have been seriously injured or died. She seemed too fine. ***************SPOILER**************** I thought the plot that led to Jason being Superman's son seemed very confusing. I really hadn't figured out whether or not this film is a continuation of the original Superman movies.This movie really didn't show Superman's well true personality. I think that Superman was used too much of a publicity and a big shot seeking for only glory and a attention seeker. This didn't show his true character. ***************SPOILER**************** I didn't really understand the subplot of how Richard came into Lois's life. There was definitely no background of Superman's past that led to him leaving Lois and the rest of mankind in order to find the remains of the Planet Krpyton. This story and the main plot really lacked emotions and heart. Well,lastly, what really troubled me was the main overall theme of the movie.*****************spoiler************************ Lois Lane lied about her appeal and love of Superman to Richard. Basically, I do not think that lying about her relationship was the best option. I guess you could say that the theme of this movie is hope for a savior to arise. But to tell you the truth, I really do not like how this movie is based on Christainty on comparisons to Jesus/Moses. That was one of Singer's plans for this movie to be enjoyable to everyone including religion... So yea this is my overall analysis on Superman Returns",2,2,mlisarules,"Jun 29, 2006",

6,Superman saved by Spacey and special effects,"The man of steel has returned to the big screen with his first motion picture in over 20 years. But with a borderline corny script and head-scratching casting choices, will he have enough strength to save this movie from despair?In short, yes. Superman Returns is an exciting film with quirky moments of comic (no pun intended) relief and not-so-cheap thrills. The seemingly limitless abilities of the special effects team serve as much of the life support for the film. In what would be an otherwise laughable attempt to showcase Clark Kent's ability to fly, see through walls and lift airplanes, the effects team proves to be the real hero of Superman Returns.The real hit-or-miss part of the film is its cast. In an awkward attempt to flex his dramatic muscles, Kal Penn plays Stanford, one of Lex Luthor's partners in crime. With little to no lines (give or take 2 words), Penn nonsensically draws attention to himself if not only for his post Harold and Kumar fame, for a few long takes that, even if not on purpose, continue to stress the fact that he is in the film.With the choice of the relatively unknown Brandon Routh as Clark Kent, it is a wonder how they could find a virtual no name to play Superman but refused to for Lex Luthor's goons. In any event, Routh is a perfect example of being able to look but not play the part. His best moments come when he isn't saying anything at all. While his acting seems somewhat forced as Superman, he plays Kent's awkward antics with relatively comfortable ease.Rough casting aside, Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lex Luthor outshines most of the cast put together. He is at once calm and vengeful, and not the least bit sympathetic. Bringing life to much of his scenes, his mere presence on screen puts the viewer on edge.Even with its flaws, the film doesn't cease to stay interesting...until the end. At least a half hour could have been cut out of its 154 minutes. Don't be surprised to find yourself arguing with your friends about when it SHOULD have ended.But if you cut out the lagging last portion, what is left is a film that accomplished what it set out to do. It is a simple and fun film that will have your heart racing at Superman's every attempt to save the world. While not always pleasing to the ears, Superman Returns is surely a feast for the eyes and is worth seeing once, but probably only once.",3,3,scott_mores-1,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,"""Dynamite, Not Green Kryptonite""","I admit to having some reservations about this movie...not that I dislike Superman. To the contrary, he's always been my favorite superhero. I grew up during the Man Of Steel's golden age era between the covers of DC Comics. No, I experienced trepidation because so much time had passed since the previous film, the horrendous ""Superman IV, The Quest For Peace."" Add to that, the fact that, with the exception of archival voice-over material from the late Marlon Brando, none of the original actors were returning to the franchise. I was not bolstered by the Prue-title sequence which seemed decadent, and shamelessly puerile considering that no one in the audience had any reason to have confidence in this movie.I'm elated to report that my fears had no basis. Bryan Singer did one hell of a job bringing Superman back to life (or back to relevance, depending on how you view the situation). By the end, I came to realize what this movie was really about. The opening hook did have its place--it was not meant to celebrate the grandeur of an aging, long underwear hero. To the contrary, it was a reaffirmation--a rededication. Superman had lost his place. This film was about the painful journey we all sometimes have to make; it's about finding your place in a world where you no longer seem to fit in. Brandon Routhe emotes this well, both as Kal-El, but somehow, even more profoundly, in his alter ego, Clark Kent. It's in the crestfallen looks...the bittersweet caesura. The notion that he may not be able to reintegrate into society overshadows every scene in the movie in a way that's poignant, and significant.The movie is long, but don't let that deter you. There's a huge payoff at the end. You will be well rewarded for the time you spend watching it.Kate Bosworth was awesome as Lois Lane. Perfect casting.Frank Langella was amazing in the unusual role, for him, of Perry White.Kevin Spacey is always top notch.

And then Superman arrived on screen and he saved the day. It is a little more of a chick flick (like the director said), but still has quite a few action packed sequences.

7,"Great special effects, but not that great","OK, it's a good movie so it gets 7 out of 10. But it's dragged out far too long, and in my opinion, the key actors are too young to pull off their ""perceived maturity"". I mean, if Superman's been gone for the past 5 years, and we consider that it's a sequel to Superman II, how come he still looks like he's 18 years old, know what I mean? Bosworth herself is only 23 years old and she even looks younger than her age.But there are some nice surprises and Kevin Spacey's performance, although short, is very good. I like the plot though, I just wish they had characters (as opposed to playing characters) to deliver it a little better. Clark for example, spends almost all his on screen time just driving the point that he acts like a dork. (Clark = Superman? nah!).There's something missing about this movie - but I guess I let my love for the hero and my knowledge of the past superman movies/stories fill in the gaps. My hopes were up too high maybe. The special effects are great but that goes without saying for any Hollywood movie during the past decade - bigger and better to try to get you to buy that popcorn.

But at the same time, don't be expecting a lot for character development and a story that will separate Superman from the rest.In reality, its one of those slam bang summer movies that'll make you forget about it once you get out of the theater. Considering director Singer did the relatively entertaining X-MEN and X2 movies, that's a pretty big letdown. There are parts where they try to make Clark Kent into Peter Parker with the whole ""pathetic nerd"" stereotype, but it doesn't flow well here. Mostly in part because Peter is...well, human and believable. Clark obviously isn't, he's not even human for one. So there were some things that couldn't add or make up, instead of sticking with an ""outsider"" theme (which is much more appropriate), they did that instead.Lois Lane herself was pretty interesting...to look at, anyway. Kidding aside, she (being pretty critical to the plot) did her job and had some interesting moments to help balance out the whole Superman-Lois thing. The only other noteworthy character was Kevin Spacey as the infamous Lex Luthor, possibly the best actor in the entire movie. His lines and the jokes were worth most of my admission price, I can see why the fans really wanted him to be Lex.Jimmy Olsen, which is the only OTHER character I can think of that's worth mentioning, tries to be the comic relief here. Purely hit or miss, i'll let you decide on him.In short, if you don't like decent-development and writing, then you're not going to like this movie. I won't say anything about the story except for the fact its a cliché'd plot with average execution (and a nice little twist). It's not going to bring the house down like Spiderman or cause fans to just up with glee like Batman Begins, but it will provide average entertainment for those who just wanna casually see another Superhero film that's brought somewhat more faithfully to the big screen.But if you're expecting the big ""Superman Comeback""...lemmie say this, don't give your hopes up. Just look for a decent movie to pass the time with your girl/boyfriend or family and you'll do just fine.",2,2,TheWillVega,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,"The Legend Lives On! Sit back, relax and enjoy it.  The S is back!","What an amazing job Bryan Singer has done with Superman Returns. Its hard to imagine anyone doing a better job of it. It has stayed very true to the 1978 Christopher Reeve version and also to Superman II. While I don't want to give anything away from the movie, all I can say is just see it. Brandon Routh is excellent as Clark Kent/Superman. After reading some of the rubbishing reports of Routh's performance, I cannot wonder but think if they had been watching the same movie. Routh has picked up so many of Reeve's Superman mannerisms/style that it is great to watch. Which was the most important part for me, being that Reeve has always been the definitive Superman in my eyes. The soundtrack is amazing as well. so well done and i was interested to see how a different composer would add his own unique style to the already John William's masterpiece. And John Otto has done it very well.The whole movie was a big nostalgia trip, being 27 years since I saw the 1978 version. The care that director Singer has shown in this movie is amazing.

4,Good Visual Effects,"It's a rather decent movie but I have to give it a rating of 4 because the Lois Lane character is rather bland and boring and a good deal of the film revolves around the Superman / Claark - Lois relationship. I'm disappointed in this area because all previous Lois Lane's have had a lot of back bone and spunk. They were strong women. This Lois as afore mentioned is just bland and without personality who has a boring child and husband or partner( a bit unclear). Otherwise it's quite an enjoyable film. The New superman is good, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther is great and so is Parker Posey. Good to see Jack Larson & Noel Neal get some work out of it as well. Visual effects are excellent but the movie should have had a bit more action or been shorter or a better Lois. Cheers to all. Diego",0,1,Diego2001,"Jun 29, 2006",

I can't put a finger on why, but the movie made me feel this way.Even though I thought Kevin Spacey was sort of flat and the diabolical plan he came up with was sort of lame, it didn't faze me like a weak idea normally would.I spent $12.50 watching this movie (IMAX), and it was worth every cent.I spent $0 watching X3 and still felt cheated.",1,1,ma_ge,"Jun 29, 2006",
3,Superman Returns  - Tired Franchise Syndrome,"This is not a new, original movie... like ""Batman Begins"". In fact, little is new, and that is disappointing. The tired old footage of Marlon Brando was not an homage, it was a mistake. I would have preferred to see Jor-El re-cast, with maybe Paul Newman. It was a bad move. Next, they ripped of many of the musical themes from the first movie; those too were tired. I counted at least 3 themes borrowed. The title sequence was borrowed. There was yet another romantic flight scene. I felt like I was watching a re-make of the first movie, with few exceptions. Superman should have been entirely made from whole cloth. It would have made the difference between an average summer Hollyweird ""blockbuster', and an epic. Singer chose average.That brings me to Singer, probably one of the worst directors in Hollyweird today. In addition to the mistakes above, Singer infused this movie with little soul. The emotions were plastic, and I never really cared for any of the characters by the end of the movie. The special effects are standard fare; nothing new or exciting. Yes, better than the original, but that is not saying much. Compared to other current movies, the effects were just as bland as the next one. Singer has a habit of making plastic films, like X-Men. There is little difference between Singer's Superman and X-Men.The plot sucked. Once again, we get the old Lex Luthor takes over the world plot. Christ.... imagine if they gave Lex a break, and focused on a different arch enemy. It would have made the franchise fresh. Nope. Can't do that. Gotta stick to the tired Lex Luthor world domination / kill Superman plot. Nothing real inventive in the plot, which again borrows from the first movie.Overall, a very forgettable movie. To make it worse, two mongoloided retards sat next to me and talked throughout the whole movie, even after they were asked to stop. When they weren't talking, one of them was sucking snot out of his nasal cavity and into his stomach. This went on and on. They were actually retards, so pointing that out to them might not have been the kindest thing I have ever done. It was satisfying after 2.5 hours of snot sucking, however.The best part of the movie was the hotdog I ate before it started.",9,8,Richard-Noggin,"Jun 29, 2006",

7,Not quite Batman Begins...but still good stuff!,"Here's all the negatives I heard about this movie before going in: (1) neither Bosworth nor Routh's performances were any good, (2) Spacey's Luthor was too circus-y, (3) the special effects were sub-par, and (4) the plot was weak and you didn't care about the characters. LET ME DISPEL ALL OF THOSE RUMORS NOW. This movie was great. I cared for the characters, and generally the acting was great. The special effects (aside from the opening credits sequence) were pretty impressive and almost seamless. True fans of the original movies will find numerous (funny) homages paid to those classics. They kept a lot of the original score composed by John Williams, who is without a doubt the greatest composer of our generation. Everyone recognizes this score...in a couple hundred years people will be talking about John Williams the way we talk about Mozart, Bach, Brahms, Beethoven, and Strauss.Aside from a couple of questionable plot points that the average movie-goer would never notice anyway, I thought this movie was a very good blockbuster. Is it THE blockbuster of the summer? Probably not...that title has to stick with X-Men: The Last Stand so far...we'll see if anyone unseats it this summer. But everyone knows who Superman is, and he is the reason that comic books are what they are today. The only real problem I had with the movie were the ages of the main characters played by Routh (27) and Bosworth (23)...they were much too young to be five years older than where the movie is supposed to pick up. The original Lois Lane played by Margot Kidder was 32 and the original Superman, Christopher Reeve was 28. I know the reasoning behind this, though and can accept it and grow with it...especially since I thought Routh and Bosworth did such a good job (especially Bosworth...boy do you feel for her character, had she been 10 years older, it would have been perfection). But, I imagine if this movie does well at the box office (and it should), there will be sequels and it takes a few years to churn out these huge blockbusters. We couldn't have 40+ year-old Superman and Lois Lane...and kids today will grow up with Routh and Bosworth the same way I grew up with Reeve and Kidder.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys blockbusters, comic-book movies, Superman in general, action flicks, drama, and romance.",3,3,Obi-WanKEGnobi,"Jun 29, 2006",
,Finally a good superman movie.,"I will say that I was never much of a fan of the Superman movies as I was with the show. Superman 1 was very well done, 2 was decent, 3 was a complete mess, and 4 was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I personally like to imagine it ended after 2. Do not get me wrong I thought Christopher Reeves was the best Superman anybody could ever be. I just thought that the story, dialouge etc. etc. was brutal in 3 and 4. Finally the Classic superman has come back as he is meant to be in my eyes. Brandon Routh was spectacular as the man of steel, and although for many years Terri Hatcher was always my vision of Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth nailed the role perfectly. Kevin Spacey however is a different story. I really enjoyed Mr. Spacey in movies like The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, but for some reason I just didn't think he was the right choice for Lex Luthor. I found his character to be a little cheesy and some of his lines really annoyed me. Bryan Singer did the best job that anybody could ever do on a Superman movie and the special effects were mind boggling. Anyways I advise anyone who likes superhero movies to see this movie. Let me rephrase that you must see this movie, it's Superman man people he's the one that started it all.",0,1,BCantor89,"Jun 29, 2006",

7,"""It's A Bird, It's A Plane, It's....One Great Movie""","Superman leaves earth to see if there are any remains of his home planet, Krypton. Five years later, Superman returns...but now things are different. Lux Luthor is out of prison, Louis Lane has found a new love and has a child. Is there really a need for Superman anymore?Bryan Singer is no stranger to comic book films, after all he's directed two of them himself. Singer left the X-men series to try and tackle something bigger, something that would prove to be a challenge for him. In terms of superheros, you can't get any bigger then the Man of Steel himself, Superman.Many people will say to this day that Christopher Reeves is the one and only Superman. While he was good for the role, Brandon Routh does an exceptional job at resurrecting that character and breathing new life into him. At first some may be hesitant of the newcomer, but he does not disappoint. Not only does he do a great job with Superman, but also excels with Clark Kent. Looking almost identical as Reeves, Routh pulls off both identities of Superman. I guess you can say that the torch has been passed on now. Even though Routh is excellent as Superman, he is not the stand out performance in this film. Before you even see the film, you know who is going to ""own"" the film and he does. Kevin Spacey is Lex Luthor and he does it so incredibly well. You can't help but smile whenever his shinny bald head, which is a good look for Spacey, comes upon the screen. He plays Luthor with a little bit more evil then Hackman did, with a small humours side. Kate Bosworth plays the role as it is written, and nothing more. Margot Kidder is still the one and only Louis Lane. Bosworth was out of place and they could have found another actress to play her....Rachel McAdams anyone?The supporting cast, Frank Langella, Sam Huntington, James Marsden (I was waiting for him to shoot laser beams out of his eyes) all do very well in bringing back the vibe of the Daily Planet. Sam Huntington is the comic relief of the film, playing the dopey Jimmy Olsen, the only other comedy, comes from Spacey. Parker Posey was annoying in the film, she really doesn't serve a purpose other then crying on cue. Kal Penn is another character who doesn't do much but stand around.The special effects are great. With a man like Superman who has superhuman powers, you can have so much fun with it and they clearly do. Being able to see through walls was a neat addition to the film and the super hearing of people in other rooms. Of course, the plane sequence was a feat for the eyes and the final climatic scene. The film makes good use of the technique in which you convert the actor to CGI. Unlike Blade II and The MAtrix Reloaded, in which you can clearly tell the difference, here it's a little less noticeable. Granted it's not perfect, but you do have that ""Look how fake that was"" look on your face through the film.The story is very much like something that you can pull right out of the comics. Luthor trying to raise his own continent while the Kryptonite. Throughout the whole film though, the ""how am I going to get out of this situation"" seems to lack a bit, cause you know that at the last second Superman will come and all he has to do is fly here, stop that, or pull this. There's a little bit of tension with the characters, but you know at the end of the day that they are all going to live, because it IS Superman.I did get chills with the opening credits, hearing Brando's voice, then the old school Superman theme. It sends chills down the spine, in a good way. Then the names fly across the scene, much like the original. The theme is all over the movie and the score has that ""comic book epic"" tone to it. Although, after the climax of the film it does go on for awhile, so near the end of the film it does drag a bit. The whole Superman in hospital scene was ""what the hell"" moment.Overall this is a great film, with only one or two missteps. Singr does an excellent job at reinventing the Superman franchise, much like Nolan did with Batman. Superman is the best superhero film this year and one of the best all time. It is leaps and bounds over X-Men: The Last Stand. Returns is the summer event of the year and it's action and energy leaps over tall buildings. Pirates will be huge as well and great indeed, but Superman Returns is a film that people have been waiting for for years and it does not disappoint.",2,2,Matt_Layden,"Jun 29, 2006",

The storyline dragged on and on and on and on like this sentence. The movie is 2 hours and 37 minutes, if it were cut down to 2 hours, which it easily could be, it would be vastly improved. The love story between Superman/Louis Lane was way too long and over-dramatic. I left the theater wanting more and slightly disappointed with its lack of ""it"".

6,"Not a ""chick flick"" but not a comic book based movie either....","At least not a successful one. Many early reviews stated that the movie was a complete chick flick which it is not, however that is not to say that the movie does not have those few moments of irrelevant romance that lack contribution to the general plot. Brandon Routh plays an excellent Superman despite what many people may believe. Kevin Spacey was the perfect Lex Luthor, the audience actually despises him at times. However, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) lacks a lot of the qualities that make her Lois Lane. She is a career woman yes, but not a sarcastic, busy woman who can actually be romantic at times, but rather more like a career woman who has no time for anyone and has the personality of a bitter ex-girlfriend who is slightly bipolar (maybe just a little too harsh). That said my original score was going to be a 7 had it not been for Bryan Singer's ""misguided direction"" for lack of a better term and to avoid calling him a horrible director. Simply put, he is overrated, and being so often makes people forgive him too easily, but not me. Although it is true that you should never walk into a movie that is based on a book or comic and expect a flawless transition from paper to film, there are little things that must be kept the same in order to preserve the things that make the character who he is. The problem, people said, with making Superman movies is that the man is almost perfect and therefore it is hard to find an enemy for him so writers were stumped. The problem with the direction is that unlike Spider-Man (Marvel, I know, but bare with me) and Batman (DC like Big Blue) the dilemma faced does not just affect NYC or Gotham it affects the world, and in doing so there is a complete lack of acknowledgement towards the DC universe, the Superheroes that make him who he is, both by complementing his weakness's and emphasizing his strengths are not even mentioned and it makes it seem as if Superman is the only hero. Things, that were contemplated in the comics, but were scrapped because of the inevitable results which had to be avoided are revived here in what seems to me, as some fan-boys sick dream (not necessarily Singer but most likely), although I won't spoil it for anyone, if you don't know yet, when you see the film you will instantly know what I am talking about. All in all the film earned a 5 for directing and a 7 for the acting but an 8 for special effects (not factored into my original score) so I will revise my vote to a 6 instead of a 5. The average movie goers seemed to like it, but if you know even a little tiny bit about comics, I doubt you will appreciate it.",1,2,IvanSanchez716,"Jun 29, 2006",

The music made me weep it was so good to hear and see again on the big screen! Seeing the original-style titles with that *HUGE* Superman logo appear was just an indescribable feeling for me. It warmed my heart. :-)I wasn't bugged at all with Lex's plan. I think he must live by the motto, ""If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."" He failed with his land deal in the first movie, so he tries it again. And to him, it's not all about money. He would like to go down in the history books as the man who killed billions of people. He doesn't care how he does it. Spacey was excellent. No complaints there. He was basically Hackman with an edge. His best scene was with the toothbrush in his mouth. :-DSurprisingly, I wasn't all that bothered by Bosworth. She's still too young, but she filled the role okay.The kid wasn't as bad as I thought he'd be. I really like the relationship that started between him and Supes. Especially in light of the Jor-El speech Superman speaks to him when he's asleep. ""The son becomes the father and the father the son."" This should be interesting to see in the next few movies.Now to Routh... He was good. But he didn't hit it out of the park for me. Honestly, only Chris Reeve could do that. Chris had something special about him. His Superman really seemed like a *MAN*. Routh seems like a ""young"" man. Not all that confident. Where's the ""General, would you care to step outside?"" type confidence? He brooded over Lois too much. His line to Lex, ""I see an old man's sick joke"" was the most confident thing he said/did. That was great. Everything else was ""Meh."" (Well the mini-gun scene was cool too.) He can be great if he just adds more confidence to Superman next time.So, here's my Superman score:George Reeves: 8Christopher Reeve: 10Brandon Routh: 7As for the story itself, there wasn't a whole lot to it. Lex creates crystal continent, Superman tries to stop him & gets injured, then tries again and wins. There are no (okay, maybe one) ""connect-the-dots"" type of moments. I was hoping the guy with the mini-gun was one of Lex's henchmen stealing money for the expedition trip or something. It's really just an announcement movie saying, ""I'm back!"" but not much more. (And what happened to the mini-gun guy? At least in the original we see the fate of the different crooks.)Overall, I think the movie did what it needed to do. The important thing is that it furthered the characters and they grew. I think Superman grew with the knowledge of his son's existence. Now he understands Jor-El and Pa Kent in a whole different light. He's a changed person and does have a personal love and connection to someone like he's always yearned for. Lois too has changed... You could see how angry she was at the beginning, but realized she loved him after all. Enough to recant her whole ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman"" article.Okay, so how many references to the originals did you notice? I saw a very tiny one that many would miss...* When Lex stole the Krypton meteor, the card read it had landed in ""Addis Ababa"" just like in the original. * The ""Donner Dome"" on Krypton does make an appearance! * Also, did you see the photo of Glenn Ford in the Kent house? * And Lois still smokes and can't spell (and finally won her Pulitzer.) * The line ""I hope this incident hasn't put you off flying. Statistically speaking, it's still the safest way to travel."" Oh, and Lois fainted right after Superman said that. * It was fun to see the TV show Jimmy and Lois again. I only wish George and Chris could have been around to do cameos too. * And I had read about the very end scene where he flies off into space a la Chris Reeve. That was PERFECT! Again, I wept when I saw that! FRIGGIN AWESOME! I want to see the whole movie again just for the opening and closing!So, here's my movie ratings:Superman: The Movie: 9.5Superman II: 10Superman III: 6Superman IV: 2Superman Returns: 7 (I just knocked it a point for taking out the ""Truth, Justice and the American way."" line. >:-( )Not as good as the first two movies, and just a bit better than III.

10,Does the world need Superman?,"This movie asks the question of it's characters, ""does the world need Superman."" In it's construction and execution, it asks of it's viewers, ""does the world need a Superman movie?"" I had goosebumps through the opening credits. There is a magic to the Superman myth, and from the get-go, Bryan Singer pretty must states that he's a big-league A-list director, but he's *NOT* going to make Superman his own. He's dealing with something bigger than himself here, and he's going to respect that.Batman and Spiderman have achieved great success as superheroes and as movie franchises by being quintessentially human. For all their power, their greatest weakness is their underlying humanity. For the movies, this struggle with humanity is what makes them successful. (I'm purposely considering only the bookend Batman movies here.) Superman's not human, and he doesn't have human weaknesses. He's a pretty flat character in a 21st century of back story, darkness, and closeted skeletons. That's a difficult sell, to be sure.The magic of the Superman story has always been the ""nick of time"" rescue. Singer uses this technique, but in a quid pro quo. Superman rescues, but at the same time, the side characters become self-reliant and do their fair share of rescuing themselves.I hear the comment, ""something's missing."" The piece that's missing is Superman at the center of this movie, and I'm not sure that it's a bad thing. Everybody is at the center of this movie, reacting to the presence or absence of Superman. It's a bold technique, given that it requires the audience to meet it halfway, and some people just don't do that. To watch this, and appreciate it, you have to watch with your heart.So back to the question, ""Does the world need another Superman movie?"" IMHO, there's an undeniable and unmatchable magic to be found in a movie that has a distinct lack of cynicism. It's fun and it's touching, but most of all, it's refreshing that a movie can reach heights such as these without having to find a new dark corner of the human soul. The movie is pure magic and can take us all back to the days when we were innocent and believed that good will win and bad will lose. For everybody who has lost touch with that innocence, a Superman is sorely needed.**** On a total side note, the age-old maxim should now read, ""don't do scenes with kids, animals, or Parker Posey."" She can do no wrong, and almost walked away with this whole movie in her back pocket.",1,2,mrmatt14,"Jun 29, 2006",
8,"The Rebirth of Superman: A well made, yet flawed, homage of a sequel","A new Superman movie has been in development hell for as far back as anyone can remember. Yes, Kevin Smith had some interesting anecdotes about his attempts at writing a screenplay for Jon Peters, but otherwise, we have endured many years of television shows and comics, but no new big screen adaptation. Finally, Bryan Singer, the man who made comic book movies ""cool"" again, was contracted and taken away from his beloved X-Men to create his interpretation of Superman. And while not perfect, it is definitely something to marvel at.Superman/Clark Kent (newcomer Brandon Routh) has been away from Metropolis for five years. Upon returning, he learns of how people got along without him, and how many people, like his love Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), have moved on entirely. But while many are glad to see him back, his arch-nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is not, and as could be predicted, has come up with a cunning plan to try and take over the world, and defeat the Man of Steel in the process.Understandably, the plot does not sound entirely too amazing, but the film has been hyped enough that it speaks for itself. It has officially brought Superman back to life, and like Batman Begins before it, has rejuvenated an otherwise dead franchise. Wisely choosing not to redo the franchise over, Singer has made an epic homage and true sequel to Superman II. Yes, it has a few flashback moments and blatant pieces of dialogue to help those new to the franchise, understand it better. Having never seen the films from beginning to end, but knowing enough about them, I found this to work great in the film, and make feel more original than it would have with anyone else.Routh is no Christopher Reeve, but he does great as the titular character. He fills the big shoes proudly, and has enough charisma and talent, to make us believe that he is Superman and Clark Kent. He looks throughout the entirety of the film that he is attempting to do the role justice, and it shows in the strength of his performance. Another wise decision on Singer's part. Bosworth, while nowhere near as strong a presence in the film, holds her own, and shows off the independence of Lois Lane. There are a few cases where she falters, but otherwise, she does a fairly admirable job. Both her and Routh play off each other well in their scenes together, and have great chemistry. While the love triangle involving their characters and Richard White (James Marsden, in a much bigger and much more rewarding role than in X-Men: The Last Stand) is only amped up slightly, they still work well and do not retract from the story.But, as expected, it's Spacey's Lex Luthor that shines the most out of any of the characters. His role is darkly humorous and devilishly evil at the same time. He takes away any joke Gene Hackman may have made of the character, and has made him downright sadistically evil. If you believed that Routh could make a man fly in tights, then Spacey downright epitomizes a man of pure evil. This is a true incantation of Luthor, and a key improvement in this sequel. The performance he makes here, ranks right up there with The Usual Suspects, American Beauty and Se7en.The rest of the supporting cast, from Marsden to Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen, to Frank Langella as Perry White, to even the young Tristan Lake Leabu as Lois' son Jason, all give terrific turns as their character. They complement the big stars around them, and strengthen their performances. The archived footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El was a great addition to the cast as well. Kal Penn and Parker Posey turn out to be disappointments, as they basically stand and do very little, if anything, in the scheme of things. They are totally overshadowed by everyone, and just seem weak and useless by the finale.The special effects are absolutely top-notch. Every flying sequence is spectacular, and all the action going on looks even better. The effects are so good that it almost seems like Routh really can fly. The scenes showcasing Superman's powers like his super-hearing, his ability to see through objects, and more all take full advantage of the special effects, and all look equally as good as his flying. The opening credits are a particular standout (as both a good effects piece, and a great homage to the original films. The score is just as great, even though the original theme song is played a little too many times.But the film does have faults. Where some of the acting stalls, the storyline does too. It gets bogged down with a little too much going on, that it loses the edge it had at the beginning. The final forty-five minutes of the movie feels dragged right out, and just does not feel right in the entire scheme of things. It felt boring, unnecessary, and completely ill-fitting. I did not notice anything gay or Christ-like about it like I had heard in other reviews, it simply just does not work. It feels awkward, and is totally underwhelmed in comparison to everything else. Singer fumbles an otherwise great movie here, and it just does not totally recover by the end.Superman is reborn in 2006, and he comes out swinging. The finale is a bit of a disappointment, but Bryan Singer's creation is just too well made to completely crumble. Great performances, excellent effects and even better homages make for an otherwise good film that could have used a little bit of extra work. After seeing the care and devotion here, I can only imagine what Singer's version of X3 would have looked like.8/10.",6,2,DonFishies,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,Excellent! a masterpiece,"After reading some really good reviews on this site. I actually went to see this movie. Honestly, I am not a big fan of Superman, but this movie proved me wrong. All the effects, all the visuals, blow me away. When I saw that the movie is 2 and a half hour long, I thought that it would be boring at some point but when I get in, I forgot the time and when the movie ended, I didn't even know it. I felt like its not enough for me, I want more and more of superman. I hope that they will make another superman movie. Brandon Routh is awesome, and I gotta give some credit to Kate Bosworth too. This movie will make their names two of the big names in Hollywood.Perfect. Rate 10/10",1,2,boymissyou_vt,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,Superman Returns and Apologizes for the last 2 movies...,"I was completely floored by this movie. I felt tingles in my body when I heard the beginning of John Williams' Superman fanfare and kept feeling them throughout the entire show. Superman Returns delivers. Brandon Routh is Superman just like Christopher Reeve was Superman and just like George Reeves was Superman. He is also Clark Kent. He is not carbon copy of Reeve's portrayal, but he IS the character. I believe he can fly. I believe he can catch an airplane. I believe he is bulletproof. Kevin Spacey was Lex Luthor. The best. Just the right mix of megalomania and psycosis. Kate Bosworth was Lois Lane. She was strong, a real woman. She didn't swoon at the sight of Superman after a 5 year absence, she just went, ""Oh he's back, whatever, I have a life and it doesn't revolve around him."" Bryan Singer rocked my socks off with his great composition! Long live Superman and I hope to see a few sequels.",1,2,VariablePenguin,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,Holy Smokes!!!,"I am just getting in from the theater. I still can't believe what I've seen. After the magnificent disappointment X-Men 3 turned out to be I was sure Superman Returns would best it even if it was marginally interesting. What I saw tonight was not only breathtaking, it was almost...beautiful. Yeah, I know I'm a guy but who the hell cares. The story, actors, special effects and everything else about this movie was first rate. There was moments of pure joy and moments of tremendous sadness. Most of these moments written on the face of the wonderful actors who took the role quiet seriously. ""Superman"" the movie made us believe a man could fly, ""Superman Returns"" will let us believe that he brings hope with him. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this movie. As a plus, if you have a Christian faith background, you will be pleased to know that some early reports were incorrect. This movie does not knock Christianity, in fact, I believe its actually pro-Christianity. Definitely a five (*****) star movie.",3,2,aztecaguila2004,"Jun 29, 2006",
10,This IS the best movie of the summer (and I can say that with a clear conscience...),"Okay, I was one of those who was against the making of yet another Superman movie. I am more of a Bats-fan myself, and seeing a Superman movie... Well, I wasn't too thrilled. I thought it would be just a trounce through Metropolis with newcomer Brandon Routh as the Superman that Christopher Reeve portrayed, and Kevin Spacey as the Lex Luthor Gene Hackman portrayed in the originals. My personal thoughts on this particular movie were, ""They should restart the series like they did with Batman Begins, that was much better than the rest of them, and they should do the same thing with Superman"".Boy, was I wrong.From the very get-go, the movie grabs you and never lets go. From the very beginning, when you hear the original theme composed by John Williams, you are in awe that they actually kept that little bit. It wouldn't be Superman without it. After the opening credits, the story unfolds and you are caught up in this. Brandon Routh made for an excellent Clark Kent/Superman (both the hero and his alter-ego); as one person said, it was ""Lex Luthor playing Kevin Spacey playing Lex Luthor""; Kevin Spacey was absolutely insane as Superman's arch-nemesis, in a good way. Kate Bosworth, while an odd choice for Lois Lane, Superman's love interest, made for an interesting interpretation of the character, which was great to see.Not only do the actors help to contribute to the excellence of the movie, but Bryan Singer's direction, and the story itself are absolutely great. The story should send traditional Superman fans into a tizzy, but it's still a good foray into Metropolis. The Return of Superman is definitely a movie to see this summer. One final comment: When I went, I bought my friend's ticket, and I told him it was on me. When we came out of the theater, he told me, ""Dude, I'm definitely paying you back for this; thank you for inviting me"". I've never had anyone offer to pay me back when I said it was on me. That's how good this movie is. DC is definitely two for two right now...",2,4,wrc5577,"Jun 29, 2006",
,Big Disappointment,"Wow just saw the movie and it was incredibly disappointing. First of all there was ZERO chemistry between Superman and Lois. Second of all ~ as Ebert pointed out ~ the character ""Superman"" didn't say anything. He acted like Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent but there was no warmth or character. When he did actually utter words as Superman he sounded like Christoper Reeve again. Call me old fashioned (I'm 34) but I don't like the fact that Lois has a kid and he doesn't know who his daddy is. Poor Richard thinks it's his kid. Kevin Spacey was great as usual but again his character didn't have the depth of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, he was just pure evil. The only two elements of the movie I enjoyed were the nostalgic theme music and the special effects..........which obviously blew the originals away. I grew up with Christopher Reeve's Superman so I have a special place for them but was really looking forward to ""Superman Returns"". I've seen others say that it isn't fair to compare this movie to the originals....BS. I could feel the crowd at the theatre waiting for something to grab on to in the movie but there was nothing. The opening special effects with the plane were cool though. Maybe the sure to come sequels will be better.",3,3,robertborden,"Jun 29, 2006",

9,The heart and soul of Superman Returns,"Expectations were heavy when I first saw the trailer for Superman Returns and desperately wished that the film could deliver some of the magic of the original Superman and its excellent sequel. Superman 3 and 4 were somewhat enjoyable but disconnected films which I couldn't embrace with the joy of the first two films which I saw at ages 5 and 7. I feared maybe I was too old for Superman. With Superman Returns, I discovered the magic was not gone.Bryan Singer has done a wonderful job putting Superman back in the emotional and visual context of the superior first two Christopher Reeve led Superman films. He is faithful and genuinely careful to reinvigorate the Superman legend but not without a super-twist which I won't spoil for impending viewers and which I would avoid seeking out as not knowing what was to come made this film a much better experience for me.What also made this film work for me was the careful balance of characterization and action which made the earlier films so magnificent in tone and pace. Kate Bosworth is no Margot Kidder and lacks the vibrant intensity of her predecessor, but she and Brandon Routh have chemistry and she does well to make the role her own in a slightly less edgy way. Its the only slight disappointment but it didn't hurt the film for me.Kevin Spacey runs riot with Lex Luthor in a way not dissimilar to Gene Hackman but with a more sadistic edge. I enjoyed and was thrilled by Superman Returns which offers all the fun and excitement of the films which I loved as a kid. Although I am older,it was nice to be roused and moved by the music, characters and skillful direction once again. Can't wait for more. Excellent.",0,1,Mattydee74,"Jun 30, 2006",
9,The World Needs a Savior,"In Director Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"", Superman (newcomer Brandon Routh) has been gone from Earth for 5 years searching the galaxy for the remains of his home world Krypton. Superman or Kal-El (son of Krypton Leader Jor-El) discovers that he is the last of his kind, an outcast. Upon returning to Earth in a fiery crash back in the fields of Smallville Kansas, he confides to his adoptive mother Martha Kent (very good Eva Marie Saint) that he is truly ""all alone"". During the hero's 5 year absence, the World continued on without Superman. So has the love of his life, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Lois, now with Richard White (James Marsden), nephew of ""The Daily Planet"" Editor Perry White (Frank Langella), has a young son Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). So Superman's alter ego Clark Kent (Routh) returns to Metropolis and his post at ""The Daily Planet"". Superman reunites with Lois in a visually breathtaking airline rescue, signifying his return. Superman/ Clark Kent is devastated that Lois perhaps is in love with another. Superman then recalls the words of his father Jor-El (the late Marlon Brando), ""…They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you... my only son."" But for Superman his father's words hold little consolation.During the past 5 years, Lois won the Pulitzer Prize for writing the article, ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"". Superman and Lois meet atop ""The Daily Planet"" tower for a heart to heart. Lois tells Superman, ""The world doesn't need a savior."" Mostly she is angry that he didn't say good-bye before he left. So it is not so much that Superman left the World, it is that Superman left her. Also during his absence, Superman's mortal enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from prison. Lex still obsessed with the Man of Steel, begins to unravel the mystery of his nemesis discovering the Fortress of Solitude near the North Pole and uncovering the secrets of the set of crystals from Krypton. Lex formulates his plans for global domination. Now standing in his way is in fact Superman.Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris have created an ingenious premise in this reinvention of Superman. This is interesting considering some of the press including articles in the Los Angeles Times regarding Superman in the context of a Christ figure or Gay icon. It occurred to me while watching ""Superman Returns"" that Superman may have been in his inception a Christ metaphor. Jor-El, the leader of an advanced and perhaps god-like race of a doomed world, sends his only son to Earth as a savior of Mankind. Singer dramatically uses the pose of a vulnerable Superman plummeting to Earth. Superman is willing to die for all of Mankind. Much like in his ""X-Men"" movies, Singer's theme of being alone and an outcast permeates through ""Superman Returns"". Superman has to pretend to be something that he is not—Clark Kent. As Clark he suffers because he can never tell the woman, who he loves, who he really is. Only as Superman does Clark have authentic self-expression. Superman lends compassion to anyone, who has pretended to be someone other than themselves.""Superman Returns"" is visually stunning. Bryan Singer truly captures the freedom of flight, and the spirit of the hero. Brandon Routh is amazing and powerful as Superman and Clark Kent. Routh is a great looking man with a commanding presence and lightness. He inhabits Clark with the right inept touch, understated. As Superman he has a great voice. He is strong and tempered with both compassion and courage. Comparisons to his predecessor are inevitable, and Routh is awesome. Kevin Spacey provides an unusual spin on Lex Luthor. In the beginning Lex seems more eccentric than threat. As the movie evolves Spacey harnesses a dark force and presence in Lex that is so compelling. This provides the explosive conflict between Superman and Lex. Kate Bosworth is miscast as Lois Lane. Bosworth, a talented actress, is unable to nuance the angry and hurt Lois. I think that even though Lois is the unaffected and callous reporter, deep down she is waiting for her knight in shining armor to return. That sense of regret or loss is missing in Bosworth's interpretation. An aside: From the comics either Lois is one of the stupidest people on the planet or Clark Kent is one of the greatest actors. The fact that Lois can't tell the difference between Superman and Clark Kent without the glasses and different hair part is completely boggling. At least Singer makes a joke regarding this narrative legacy.""Superman Returns"" is a great hero story. Bryan Singer masterfully tells his story of love, courage and redemption. Singer also crafts an amazing surprise in his reinvention of the Superman legend. Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey are awesome. Veteran Spacey gives new life to Lex Luthor. Routh is the charismatic young star on the rise. ""Superman Returns"" is about reclaiming and inspiring greatness. ""Superman Returns"" is also a great movie.",2,3,jon.h.ochiai,"Jun 30, 2006",
6,Another overblown mediocrity,"Another overblown action movie with too many clean-looking CGs and not enough substance. The action sequences are watchable, but half an hour's worth of story has been extended to two and half hours. Singer wanted to show a lot of flying-superman scenes where the hero pretends to be real-cool, sort of like music video scenes. This is the main reason why the movie is so long.As for acting, Spacey does a decent job as Luthor, but other characters are instantly forgettable.As for comparisons with other superhero movies, 'Batman Begins' is way way better.It's not a complete waste of money since it's got better action scenes than an average B-action films.

4,Sadly I did not enjoy it.,"I have always been a big Superman fan. I suppose the idea of flying and having super human strength has always been appealing. And I always enjoyed Richard Donner's 1978 Superman movie -- I still find myself gladly dropping whatever I am doing if I see it on television. I guess you could say that it's a really heart-warming classic. So when I heard that they were (finally) making a new Superman film I was a bit divided. On one hand I would have loved to see a new Superman film. On the other hand I worried that the filmmakers are going to somehow muck it up a bit.Sadly in this case I have to say I thought the film was a bit of the latter and not enough of the former. At two hours and thirty-odd minutes it felt a bit too long. The filmmaker could have probably cut it down by 45 minutes and it would have been a better adventure. The story paces rather slowly at times and the tone often too serious for its own good and the sentimental moments are not as compelling -- mainly due to the rather poor choices (IMHO) in casting.Do not get me wrong. Kate Bosworth will always be lovely to look at. But with the brown hair she just looked like, well... Kate Bosworth with kinky brown hair and not someone I could easily accept as Lois Lane.Perhaps it was Margot Kidder's feisty Lois, or even Teri Hatcher's sassy version in Lois & Clark. Whatever the situation to me Lois will always be a bit of a statuesque siren with a journalist streak. Kate's wonderful. But not exactly the right fit.And Brandon Routh... Well, I think he did a pretty good job with the voice, but he still stuck me more as a kid and not as the kind of man needed to fill Christopher Reeve's shoes. Perhaps I am being too harsh here. After all, after Reeves whom could possibly compare? For most people who grew up in the seventies Reeves will always be Superman. Routh does a good job playing the part, but I think they could have still done a better job in casting.As far as the pacing is concerned, like I said, it runs a bit slow at times. Not all the scenes seem necessary for pushing the drama forward. And at times it also feels a bit gratuitous as the story seemed a bit too convoluted with too many strings to tie up by the end of the film.The symbolism in the film also seems to be a real problem in this case. Give me a nickel every time someone talks about ""savior"" and I think I would probably have enough to go buy a few lottery tickets. The savior theme is really something that is set to overkill as if Singer wanted to simply reach out into the audience and browbeat the viewer into submission. There is such a thing as overkill, and this would be a good example in my opinion.The tone of the film is also rather dark. Spacey's Lex Luther is much more serious than the Hackman version, and so the character is a lot less interesting. Yes, there are a few times when Spacey is more comical and during those moments the Lex Luther character works. But there are also some grotesque moments which are supposed to be humorous which I personally found less tasteful and unnecessary for pushing the story forward. Consequently the humor needed to punch up the film's darker elements is sorely lacking and so the fun factor of the film seems rather curtailed. In my opinion Donner did the right thing by making Lex Luther the source of humor -- on one hand we need a source of release from the tension in the film, on the other hand we need the humor to remind ourselves not to take anything so seriously. To me Superman films at their best were never to be taken too seriously and once the film did it stopped becoming a superman story and more of a Singer drama. As far as the inherent themes of the Superman films to me they were about dreams, ideals, and about the inherent goodness of mankind. Clark Kent (and for that matter Superman) is a good person because of this inherent goodness bred into him by his human parents and how that goodness survives despite the weakness of others (i.e. Lex Luther) is the real focus of the story -- not, in my opinion whether or not Superman is supposedly mankind's re-envisioned Christ-like savior. Yes, Singer does touch upon these themes somewhat, but overall the themes are not clearly explored within the story. It is rather convoluted due to the numerous issues being addressed in the film -- and perhaps it would have been a lot better if Singer had decided to take half of the movie's themes and saved them for a later sequel rather than to drop them all into the audience's lap. Other than that? Well, it was alright. I still expect it to make approximately $130 million by Tuesday, however what sort of staying power it has afterward remains to be seen.",22,26,GeneR777,"Jun 30, 2006",
5,"Superman flies high, Kevin Spacey higher","Every once in a blue moon do we get the opportunity to see a movie like this. Bryan Singer, director of the Usual Suspects and Abandoner of the X-Men saga, has the rigorous task of bringing Superman back to life. Fortunately for him Kevin Spacey did all the work for him.Brandon Routh was entertaining, but as most of us suspected, he looked more like Superman than his acting told us. It's what is called role casting, and unlike fellow action man Christian Bale, Routh fails to bring the man of steel back to life. Co-star Kate Bosworth is another, yawn, unattractive female in an comic-book-movie, following the likes of Katie Holmes and Kirsten Dunst.Singer has enormous directing capability, which was partly covered by clouds for this film. The storyline was awkward and his emotional touch never completely gets through to the audience, leaving the viewer shedding a single tear or wondering how in the world did a superman movie include knocking up Lois(sp) Lane.If a movie wants to succeed it has to have someone that grabs your attention, especially in a action/adventure - esquire movie that looks to employ some quality. This has been apparent over the last several years. Ex; Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, Christian Bale in Batman Begins, Steve Zahn in Sahara. This reason is the reason that such movies as X-Men II & III, and the 2nd Spiderman got great money but failed to deliver anything remarkable to the audience. Superman, however, had such a performance. Kevin Spacey blew my mind as Lex Luther. Spacey took a conventional character and turned him into a loosey goosey evil villain who is fun to watch and times who the audience is rooting for to win.In a nutshell this movie cannot be deemed a failure nor a success, but moreover as a building block. it all hangs in the next movie",0,1,plucky08,"Jun 30, 2006",
,Issues from a fan perspective,"First of all I'd like to say that the movie was nicely done...the cg, acting etc were good. However as a fan who grew up reading DC, and who has memorized almost all the story lines in the comics post 'Crisis on Infinite Earths', and also seen every Super-Hero movie (including Dolph Lundgren's Punisher) I was a bit disturbed by the movie. For starters if anyone has read the Superman Returns Prequel comic mini-series, the one with Lois has a frame where she screams at Richard in the Delivery room....and that left me confused as whether the movie is true or the comic. Lois and Clark are married in the comics, when will that happen in the movies? And the final Fly-by....Routh has huge shoes to fill in, that of the legendary Christopher Reeve, and the kid has made a genuine effort and should be commended, but doing the final fly-by with the smile and the nod should have been avoided....I would not want a rip-off from the earlier movies, and it looked to me as a effort to cash-in on sentiments rather than do it as a mark of respect to Mr. Reeve, the one and only Superman!",0,1,animal666,"Jun 30, 2006",

I am a huge Superman fan and have been waiting for a long time too see Bryan Singers take on (in my eyes) the greatest superhero of all time. About half way into the movie I started getting worried, quietly I prayed to myself the movie would improve...My prayers went unanswered. Don't get me wrong it had some great scenes - but most of them were shown in the trailers - leaving only kinda boring ""filler"" between each action scene. The group I went with all felt the same - and yes we are superhero geeks... Sorry Superman, you have taken a tumble on my favourite superhero list. Bring on Spiderman 3!

8,Good hero movie,"Superman is always in my mind a difficult character to bring to the silver screen. A near-flawless man ( or thing ), who can survive anything is not going to create the same sort of anxiety in the audience as group of outcasts like the X-Men, a conflicted youth in Spider-Man, or a vengeful angel in Batman. Having said that, however, Bryan Singer has done well to make an interesting story in a well-acted film, with only a couple of problems letting it down.The story revolves around a returning Superman ( Brendan Routh ) who has spent 5 years looking for his home world and has now returned to Earth, to find the world he knew has changed. Meanwhile Lex Luthor ( Kevin Spacey ) looks to the return of the Man of Steel with renewed vengeance. Caught up in this is Superman's former love, Lois Lane ( Kate Bosworth ) who's love for the former sees her as a trump card for the latter.The cast for the most part acts admirably with Brendan Routh stepping into the shoes of Christopher Reeve with ease and manages to move between Kent and his more public alias easily. Spacey shows the world again how well he can tap into a villain's character, showing a short of megalomaniacal humanity that treads a line between total amorality and scientific endeavour. The weak link is unfortunately a biggie and it comes in the form of Lois Lane. Kate Bosworth is infatuated with Superman but seems to treat Kent with a sort of friendly contempt, as if he's somewhat below her and her level of journalism. Apart from this, the fact is that...well...this is Superman. A man who apparently cannot be spotted because he takes of his glasses. Who is totally invulnerable to almost all human things. He doesn't have Batman's baggage nor his flaws.However maybe I'm being too hard this movie, because it is a good yarn, and the Brando speech holds up still after 20 years.

I know 'Superman Returns' was filmed in Australia and one of Lex Luther's minor henchmen was of Asian-Indian decent, but does Warner Brothers expect me to believe the were no qualified black actors to play any of the other minor roles.

10,What an honor to the memory of Christopher Reeve's Superman,"I had originally seen the trailers for Superman Returns, and like any person who saw a man fly for the first time in the original ""Superman"" movie, I was actually rather outraged to see that they would even try to make a new Superman movie now that Christopher Reeves (may he rest in peace) was gone. But, my love for comics over-threw the idea to not see the movie. So, on opening day, I was there, as skeptical as can be. And as soon as the opening credits rolled, I knew that they were honoring Christoper Reeve's Superman. And a smile spread across my face. Then I saw how the new Superman acted as both Clark Kent and Superman, and the smile became wider. They really did do the right thing, not just in the fact that they made a new movie to continue the series (and make no mistake, this is not like Batman Begins, where they remake a series. Superman RETURNS is when Superman... RETURNS...) but they also made the right choice when they chose the actors for the movie. Not just the actor Brandon Routh, who does an amazing job not just mimicking Mr. Reeve's rendition of Clark Kent/Superman, but also by adding his own edge and charm to the character. And as for the Kevin Spacey/Lex Luthor, he was absolutely brilliant. I was worried that, like Chris Reeves, nobody could play Lex like Gene Hackman, but I was wrong. Kevin Spacey pulls yet another great movie off with his spectacular rendition of the villain who is as ruthless as he is hair-less. I thank Bryan Singer for once again an amazing flick that didn't screw up any of the legend and glory of the original comic.For those of your wondering...

8,Superman's Redemption,"Ignoring parts III and IV, and picking up after the events of II, astronomers think they have found Krypton, alive and well. Superman leaves Earth for 5 years, only to discover Krypton gone. When he returns, his whole life has been flipped around. Worst of all is that Lois Lane is engaged to Perry White's nephew, and they have a child together. Also, Lex Luthor is out of prison, and he wants revenge, no matter what it takes. Superman Returns is for the Superman series as Batman Begins was to the Batman series.I have so much respect for what Brian Singer did here. He obviously has an immense amount of admiration for the first two films, because he took that style and he did it, spot on. The movie even opens up with the same cheesy but awesome opening credits sequence, John Williams score and all. Brian Singer made a smart decision by making this the new Superman III, because this is a Superman III that fans of Superman might actually be able to enjoy. He does it with the same style and charisma as Richard Donner did it 28 years ago, with the great mix of ambitious action, funny humour, and of course the obligatory sappy drama. What I liked about this movie was that it managed to be a popcorn action flick and a serious comic book film at the same time. Just like Superman started the comic book movie craze, I think Superman Returns, with the help of Batman Begins, should teach Hollywood how to get back to telling a story instead of glitzy action scenes.The acting was awesome. Brandon Routh made a really good Superman, for this being his first big film. He bears a resemblance to Christopher Reeve, which is good. Kate Bosworth was a much more attractive Lois Lane than Margot Kidder, and she did a fine job at acting too. I loved Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. The way he played the role went right along with how Gene Hackman played it, but at the same time it was darker and more evil.Overall, Superman Returns was a very good film, and it saved the Superman series indefinitely. For any fans of the first film, see this one.8/10",1,1,theshadow908,"Jun 30, 2006",
4,"Long, slow, and not especially interesting","In my opinion, this was a very bland movie - Lex Luthor wasn't memorable (if he's just an amoral con man why should the sight of his wigs terrify anyone?). There were too many pointless ""rescue Lois"" scenes, and the subplot with the child seemed to be dragged on far too long. Somehow I kept expecting something more to come from the rescue scenes, some further plot development, but nothing ever happened. And come on, could they really not come up with just one person who questioned the fact that Clark Kent and Superman were gone for the same length of time and reappeared on the same day?

10,Singer is a genius,"West Windsor High School's favorite son, Bryan Singer, is a genius. The movie is the best action/adventure/comic book adaptation I've ever seen. Move over, Spiderman, you've been trumped! Superman Returns is a faithful, loving homage to the genre, and to the memory of Superman stories past. Brandon Routh is an eerie reminder of Christopher Reeves, and Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor will always be remembered. Parker Posey, as ever, is a delight, as Luthor's befuddled and bemused gun moll. In short, everyone in the film is delightful.Bravo, Bryan...may you live long and prosper...hey, wanna do the last three parts of the Star Wars saga? You've got MY vote!

10,Superman Returns,"I don't want to give any spoilers as I saw this film with only the limited trailers available... and I loved it! As a Superman fan I was not disappointed, I could find nothing wrong with it. It brought Superman to life flawlessly. Bryan Singer got it right.My daughter had a little problem with the casting of Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She thought Lois should be played by a woman who more reflected the physical strength of Lois's character. The problem I think is more with the world and Hollywood in particular. The current standard of beauty expects women to be so thin that bones sticking out is inevitable.",1,2,MelwinKoala,"Jun 30, 2006",
,"My review of ""Superman Returns""","Please note, there are NO SPOILERS in this review.I watched ""Superman Returns"" today.Just some of my thoughts on the movie:* The special effects are blended in very well. There were effects that made the film seem more hazy, and dream-like, a la ""Batman Begins"".* The movie did indeed seem that it was stretched out a bit too long, as many reviews have pointed out. It's about 2 1/2 hours long, and it shows when you're watching it.* I'm sure many people expected it to be an action flick, but it turned out to be more of a character analysis of Superman, and Clark Kent.* I felt that the final scenes took away from the impact of the film, up to that point. I'm not going to ruin it for you and tell you what happens, though.* Kevin Spacey, who played Lex Luthor, acted as too much of a goof to be the right villain of the movie.* Spacey either should have acted more sinister, or someone else who fit the role better should have played Luthor.* Adding in bits and pieces of previous Superman movies, specifically audio, and I believe, some video, of Marlon Brando, gave the movie a nicer touch of ""authenticity"" as it was able to somehow connect and tie in this movie with previous ones, in a way that improved the movie's experience, in my opinion.* I have not yet seen any other Superman movie yet (I know, I should!), so I can't compare with any of them.* Brandon Routh does look like a good fit for the Superman role.Final verdict: Recommended, but keep in mind that it's NOT entirely an action movie.",0,1,GaryWK,"Jun 30, 2006",

10,Superman  Returns.,"He leaves us for five years,returning to find the world, and the woman, he left behind have moved on. While the world takes him back with open arms, Lois Lane now has a son, a fiancé, and enough resentment towards the man of steel to win a Pulitzer. Now he must once again save us all from the ever notorious Lex Luther, and try to make peace with the woman he loves.Superman Returns is an amazing movie. Brian Singer's best film yet. It has everything, action, special effects, strong characters, and a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat, all the while melting your heart. Brandon Routh offers an excellent portrayal of both the superhero, and of the mild mannered Clark Kent. He has the charm, the build, even the perfect voice. While Kevin Spacey holds nothing back as the ever masterful Lex Luther. Even Jimmy Olson is back fumbling about. Brian Singer does an extraordinary job of bringing the man of steel back into our lives, and into hearts.",2,2,midnightblue_18,"Jun 30, 2006",
7,Visually Stunning Nightmare,"I sat through the first two hours of this film believing I was seeing the finest superhero movie ever produced. I spent the last hour praying to God to let it end. 25 minutes of editing would have saved this film from itself. How many scenes can you just allow the camera to pan slowly across someones face? I loved the experience of this film, but didn't anyone speak up at a test-screening and comment on the unnecessary length? Without losing one single scene I could edit this down by 20-25 minutes easily. Crop 5 seconds here, 8 seconds there, and the film would have been far more entertaining. My only thought upon leaving the theater was ""We get it, all ready!"". An outstanding film, well worth the price of admission,,but make sure you go to the restroom 5 times before it starts. Would someone please tell Hollywood that just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" was epic in length that not every huge film requires 3 hours to be great!

2,The Mythos Lives On,"After years of false starts, rumors of Nicholas Cage and Tim Burton, and the hacks McG and Brett Ratner making a Superma movie all fanboy geeks can rest easy knowing that Singer not only stepped up to the plate, but drove the ball out of the park.While the movie runs over two and half hours, only my bladder noticed. Honestly, if you haven't seen a friend in 19 years, wouldn't you want to spend at least two and half hours with them? Routh and Spacey were spot on, and even though I'd been having doubts about Bosworth I actually ended up enjoying her take on Lois.I have only one small complaint, and it will probably get me flamed. ""Truth, justice and all that stuff..."" C'mon. I understand this film has to be bankable overseas, but even in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam 70's Donner version of Superman he was allowed to fight for ""Truth, Justice and The American Way."" I comprehend that many people understandably chafe at the fact that the U.S.shoves a lot of its ""culture?"" down the world's throat. Often times I don't appreciate being exposed to much of my country's pop culture. But really, is there anything more American than Superman? Even if the movie tanks and no sequel is in the future, much thanks must go out to Bryan Singer for managing to update Supes for the 21st Century but keeping him as true to himself as he was in 1938!",4,5,wdgreen,"Jun 30, 2006",

7,Superman Returns was a perfect movie.  This is why I go to the theatre.,"Superman Returns is the reason I go to the movie theatre. It is a big screen, big sound, big theatre movie in every sense. This is what movies are about! Superman Returns was a perfect movie.As a huge fan of the Man of Steel I was darn near vibrating with anticipation when the lights went down. That excitement was only escaladed by watching the opening titles. What a brilliant throw back! For anyone watching a Superman movie for the first time they thought ""Wow, cool opening."" And those of us who have fond memories of the original four feature films were instantly taken back to a great, great memory.The story was complex enough to keep my interest for the duration and yet simple enough that the young children in the auditorium were also in deep.Brandon Routh was near flawless as 'the man'. I really have no criticism for his performance. He looked the part. He sounded the part. He was the part. Both his clumsy Clark and his gallant Superman performance were spot on.Kevin Spacey played his role well, not stealing the show but complimenting it nicely. His over the top portrayal was what I expected from him. He did manage, very easily to make me forget that I was watching Kevin Spacey and think I was watching Lex Luthor, which is his job. Well done.Lois and the rest of the cast really fit well together. I find it darn difficult to see anything to criticize in the casting department.Frankly, I find it darn tough to find anything at all that I wouldn't say was great.While watching the film I found it pretty apparent that I was watching something from Bryan Singer. As we are now used to, he put the pieces together in grand fashion. This man is becoming untouchable in the comic genre.The length was great. It went by in a blink.I was inspired, excited and absolutely wired by this movie.SUPERMAN RETURNS with greatness!",4,5,DavidBailey81,"Jun 30, 2006",
8,I don't understand the hatred for this film.....,"In the years that it has been said that Warner Brothers was going to resurrect the Superman franchise, I was both hopeful and skeptical. I love the 1978 Richard Donner film. That one and Superman II were the only good films in the series. Superman III and IV were utter embarrassments. So I thought that the new film could rectify the damage.Obviously, the new film would have the benefit of CGI. I had no doubt that the effects would be great. But would Brandon Routh succeed in the title role? Christopher Reeve is, and will always be the DEFINITIVE Superman, no one will ever be able to match what he brought to the role. Routh does what he can, he was chosen I think because he does look a little like Reeve, especially when he smiles. He does a good job, but the script doesn't give him much to say.Bryan Singer is obviously a fan of the Donner film, so he really creates an update of the Donner film. It is not a complete re-imagining of the series, a la Batman Begins. I think that is a good thing, this film positions itself really after Superman II. Superman returns after 5 years away, and Lois Lane has moved on. The film wants to explore his love for her, and also his loneliness, there are passages in the film where he is above the earth, alone. All of this is handled well, but there is a slight absence joy in the film. The Donner film took the character seriously enough to involve the viewer but the script and the actors all played there roles with a little bit of a wink, which made it all more fun. Especially Lex Luthor. Gene Hackman played the role for laughs, but was evil enough to make him a good villain. Here, Kevin Spacey plays Luthor more seriously, he is cruel and out for revenge, with an occasional funny one liner, I wish he would have chosen a lighter tone. Again, it works , but not as well as before.In general the cast is good but I think Kate Bisworth us not a good Lois Lane. She doesn't have the feistiness that I think Margot Kidder brought to the role. And there isn't great chemisrty between her and Routh. The relationship isn't fleshed out. The effects are great as expected, there is a great scene involving an airliner that is a show stopper. I think another couple action scenes would have been better.. The look of the film is taken from Bryan Singer's X-Men world. The movie is mostly shot in in blues and grays, a little more color would have been nice.All in all it is reverant to the vision laid down by Richard Donner in 1978. Perhaps too reverant. It could have used a couple of additional action scenes and Brandon Routh should have been given more of a chance to flesh out his Clark Kent. He does very little as Clark.After the pathetic films that were Superman 3 and 4 and not to mention Supergirl, this was a welcome addtion to the series for me. I wish that Bryan Singer would have been allowed to continue on with this series like it was originally planned. But because it wasnt a huge hit Warner Brothers pulled the plug. It wasntba bomb but I guess it didn't make enough money.Flawed but good film.Grade: B.",0,1,flicklover,"Jun 30, 2006",

8,Best Superman film yet.,"""You don't really love that guy you make it with now do you? I know you don't love that guy 'cause I can see right through you."" – The Clique, Superman""You wrote that the world doesn't need a savior, but every day I hear people crying for one."" – Superman, line of dialogue from the filmSuperman Returns comes to us nearly twenty years after the last Superman movie. The question on everybody's mind then: was this film worth the wait?The story opens with text on the screen informing us that after astronomers found Krypton, the planet of Superman's origin, Superman disappeared without any warning. We in the audience don't have to wait too long for him to come back, but the rest of the people in his life had to wait for five years. During that five years Lois Lane had a son, violent crime in the city rose dramatically, oh, yeah, and Lex Luthor got out of prison.Of course at the same time Superman comes back, so does Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) who informed his coworkers at the Daily Planet before he left that he'd be off globetrotting and doing some soul searching.Of course, not long after he gets back, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) gets into mortal peril. There was a funny moment in the Superman cartoon that was made during the late nineties where a group of terrorists hijack a plane on which Lois is a passenger. When she stumbles another passenger asks, ""Are you okay, Miss Lane?"" At this the hijackers adopt a stricken look. ""Lane?"" one of them says. ""Lois Lane?"" She nods. ""The one that Superman is always saving?"" Her lips curl up into a smug grin and she nods again. And of course, Superman saves the day. It wouldn't be a Superman movie if Lois Lane wasn't getting herself into life threatening situations every third scene or so. Indeed, one wonders how she lasted five years without him. But soon we stop caring because we get to see some spectacular effects as Superman makes his first public appearance in five years. And the people rejoice.And as usual, Superman is news, big news. As such, Perry White (Frank Langella) assigns his entire staff to find out everything that they can about Superman. In doing this, he pulls Lois off of another story that, really, is more important. Lois, being Lois, pursues the story anyway and gets herself kidnapped by Luthor (Kevin Spacey), who has a plan to *gasp* destroy Superman.The plan is better than any he had in the earlier films, which is no surprise, as in this film the script, acting and characterizations are all better as well. Routh delivers his lines in a style very similar to the late Christopher Reeve yet still makes the performance his own. Bosworth is far superior as Lois lane (not to mention better looking) than Margot Kidder and Kevin Spacey plays Luthor with just the right blend of sophistication and insanity. James Marsden (Cyclops from the X-Men films) also makes an appearance as Richard White, Perry's nephew and the future Mr. Lois Lane. I really didn't much care for Marsden as Cyclops, but his character here is believable. It would be easy, I suppose, to make Lois's new beau a thumb-sucking weenie to act as a convenient plot point to create tension, but director Bryan Singer (who brought us the first two X-Men films) rises above this temptation. The result is an intelligent film that pays tribute to what was good about the 1978 film while making it better, and not just as a special effects extravaganza, and brings Superman into the twenty-first century.I hope this team does more with Superman. ""Superman Returns"" is a solid, well done film, and it would be a shame to ignore the vast amount of talent that it brought together.",0,1,Bryanthemadposter,"Jun 30, 2006",

8,The Man of Steel is Back!,"... with a BANG! Literally, there's no better way to describe the movie. It's been a while since I saw any of the first 4 Superman flicks but this one carried out the grace, the grandeur and the glamor the same way it's predecessors did. Even the opening credits were done the same way.OK, there was quite a bit of weirdness. Clark/Kent here looked much younger than where he left off in the last movie. Now you must know before watching Superman Returns that this movie is a continuation of the saga from Superman II, and not IV. III was a bad downfall, and IV was a continuation from II, ignoring III ever existed. Now V has done the same thing, and I pray that if there's a VI, the story continues from V.Getting back to Superman Returns, the movie was produced and shot entirely in Australia. Beautiful locales, less hassles compared to shooting in NYC, and cheaper overall production were probably the driving factors. However, the main city in the story was still good ol' Metropolis (the big apple near, Kansas?) and everything else was same as the comics - Daily Planet newspaper, Lex Luther, Martha Kent and Lois Lane. Would be a good idea to watch the first and second movies before moving on to this one. Even if you're an ardent Smallville fan.The casting - a totally unknown actor named Brandon Routh who appeared in some daytime soap opera played the lead role of Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman. He was impressive, and justified replacing Christopher Reeve. Unfortunately he may also be type-casted and find less success in other roles the same way. In fact he looked very similar to Reeve in the outfit - they probably morphed him in the post-production to. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was adorable. She looked good, played her part well and carried the weight of the role very gracefully.The best actor in the movie, of course, was Kevin Spacey, playing S-Man's nemesis Lex Luther. For a change, he didn't try to be the same character Gene Hackman portrayed in the earlier movies, but instead improvised brilliantly and executed all sides of Luther with expertise. A villain may have greed for power, evil ideas and means to acquire that , still you can't really portray such a character in a movie to all in all bad bad bad, evil, kill the mofo type. It gets clichéd and seems like you're watching Fox News at that time if they drag the evil side too far.The script writers could have possibly borrowed some ideas to renovate Luther's character from the TV show Smallville (besides the shaved-head, yes) - but it worked all in all. Kudos to Spacey, yet again.The supporting cast of Frank Langella, James Marsden, Parker Posey and Kal Penn could be moderately commendable. Peta Wilson could be overlooked for playing the blonde MILF in the airplane escorting the shuttle, it was still nice to see her on screen again nonetheless. Even years after the show Le Femme Nikita concluded.Special Effects in this day and age were obviously dominated by CGI (like HULK), and the flying scenes were really well done. The only flaw in the movie could be it's length: over 2.5 hours long. Has a couple of slow moments. I know 2 of my friends in Dallas who fell asleep before it was halfway through, but I consider them narcoleptic anyway.Overall I rate this movie an 8.5 out of 10.

This has to be one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a while...especially after being pleasantly surprised by Batman Begins last year.Not everything is horrible...I thought the casting was great, Brandon Routh & Kevin Spacey pulled off great performances. The only problem was that there was nothing for them to perform. The movie was extremely slow, and nothing really happened. There never seemed to be any impending doom or any thought that ""oh, how is he going to pull this off"".

1,What a waste of time and money!,"I am tired of film makers focusing so much on the visual presentation of their work, that they forget to tell a compelling story. What's more frustrating is so many people have gushed praises on this film and others like King Kong and X-Men 3 that it encourages the studios to continue with these spectacular visual productions with weak story lines and poor character development. It's even more frustrating that people in mass pay to see these films and turn them into blockbusters. And most frustrating of all, I am one of those people who paid to see this film. I wish I could take it back. Superman Returns will insult your intelligence. I love action/adventure films but some of my favorites from the last couple of years haven't been the biggest hits, like Sahara (now this was a fun film to watch), and Into the Blue.

Special effects have come a long way since the 'first' Superman movies, and all I can say is THANK GOODNESS. But besides special effects, I thought the entire cast did a great job of acting. But, and of course, the number one performance, hands down, and in my opinion, was turned in by Kevin Sapcey with his portrayal of Lex Luthor! Say what you will about 'comic book' hero movies, but if they ever handed out an Oscar to an actor who played in one, then Kevin Spacey is certainly worthy! The storyline and script were somewhat expected with a couple of 'new' twists added in for good measure. Lot's of action makes the 154 minute running time seem to 'fly' by, if you will.

7,Superman Reclaims his Throne,"It shouldn't come as any surprise that the 200 million plus ""Superman Returns"" has some of the best special effects and action sequences I've ever seen. What is surprising is the way in which the large expanses of quiet, emotional scenes kept me as alert and engrossed as any of the blood and thunder managed to. Bryan Singer makes Superman seem vulnerable and human without making him any less awe inspiring. Where a less talented filmmaker would have churned out something cheesy and manipulative, he constructs a tale with real feeling. The most surprising of the plot developments departed quite a bit from comic lore and had me feeling a bit odd at first, but I ended up finding it kind of inspiring. Singer managed to wrangle up a real surprise in a story that's basically been told repeatedly for seventy years. Another aspect of the film I appreciated was Singer's use of religious symbolism, which actually gave certain scenes more gravitas, and was very subdued compared to the ""smack you over the head with a bat"" subtexts of X3.Now, the best director in the world can't do much with a bad cast, and thankfully that's not a problem here. Brandon Routh channels Christopher Reeve in nearly all his scenes and does so very effectively, coupled with his physical resemblance this reinforces a sense of continuity with the previous films. Kate Bosworth manages to fill Lois Lane's shoes admirably (making me feel a bit foolish, as I was vocal in my displeasure at her casting), as does the rest of the cast in their respective roles. Kevin Spacy was impressive as Luthor, managing to remain menacing while spouting one-liners, a feat Gene Hackman didn't pull off quite as successfully.In the end, Superman Returns stands side by side with Batman Begins as the best of the recent comic book movies. A terrific melding of talent and tech that should satisfy any movie goer. I've heard some other comic fans lambasting the one aforementioned ""departure"" from previous tales of Superman. To them I say: accept the movie on it's own terms, and you'll leave the theater happy.",2,3,Cimmerian_Dragon,"Jun 30, 2006",

7,A strange but powerful new vision of the Superman saga,"Superman Returns does things that no other Superman show has ever done and does other things far better than the shows that came before. For this reason alone, it is well worth watching.If you like Superman, you will probably love this movie. It treats Superman with a respect that few movies from comic books realize is possible and allows him to display his powers in a mature and credible fashion. Routh is engaging and believable throughout the movie, Spacey is the best Lex Luthor ever, and all of the other actors do an average job or better.The movie has two main problems. The first problem is the lack of a meaningful plot. Instead, there are several different sub-plots, most of which are executed superbly, that never come together in a coherent story line. In particular, as good as Spacey is, the sub-plot with Lex Luthor feels forced and is almost irrelevant, more of an excuse for things to happen than a worthwhile story on its own.The second problem is the overly liberal use of music. There are scenes where the music works, but for the most part it is laid on too thickly. The worst part of this problem is that every time (and I mean EVERY time) Superman is about to do something good, the scene is heralded by the Superman theme. The rest is the same problem that every movie (except Tarantino movies) has to some degree, in which the director tries to convey the emotion of the scene with music instead of allowing the audience to figure it out from the dialog, etc.I very much enjoyed watching the movie.

7,A Great Film with a Little Nostalgia,"I saw the film Friday night with my sister and I had previously read the rather unfair review by Roger Ebert. I actually enjoyed the film and I respected the fact that the film paid homage to the 1978 Superman film and to Christopher Reeve. Clark Kent aka Superman returns to Earth after five years of searching for his home planet or at least the remains of his people. He is reunited with his adopted mother, Martha Kent (Eva Marie Saint), and returns to his job as a reporter for the Daily Planet. He is also reunited and shocked to find that his long-time love, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, who is a lovely Lois Lane), has a child and is engaged to the handsome and all-around nice successful Richard White (James Mardsen). But to add insult to injury, Lois had won a Pulitzer Prize for an article she wrote entitled, ""Why The World Doesn't Need Superman."" Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (perfectly casted Kevin Spacey) is out of prison and has inherited a fortune by marrying an old, dying woman and funding a plan to create land that will inevitably destroy billions of lives. Superman is on the way and returns with a clean swoop from the sky. I actually enjoyed the film for the following reasons: 1. Brandon Routh...damn! Need I say more? No, really, he played the character beautifully knowing that it wasn't going to be easy to play the role made ten times famous by the late Christopher Reeve and he was a good Superman and I for one wouldn't mind seeing him again in a sequel. 2. For the sake of nostalgia and respect, the film pays a nice tribute to the comic book hero in a current time such as ours where there is a war and lack of leadership and a need for a hero. It is both uplifting, but at the same time sad that in times like ours we do wish for a Superman. 3. Excellent special effects makes the film intriguing to watch and fun. However, the following flaws weighed down the film (and if anyone knows the writers of this film this is an important criticism that should be taken as advice if they are thinking about a sequel): 1. the female characters were underdeveloped: Lois Lane comes off as a damsel in distress in this film compared to the 1978 version where Lois (played wonderfully by Margot Kidder) was spunky, plucky, and can fight back when threatened. In here, Lois is distant and at times acts like a deer on headlights. It's not Kate Bosworth's fault; its the script that doesn't give more to Lois in making her a real modern day female heroine and more importantly it would have been great if the writers showed us why Superman is so in love with her. Another one was the casting of Parker Posey as Lex's right hand woman and companion Kitty Kawolski: she is a clueless airhead in this film; there is no spunk or the cute sarcasm that was Valerie Perine as Miss Tretchmacher in the 1978 version. Martha Kent played by the lovely Ms. Eva Marie Saint (cool...isn't? Saint co-starred opposite Marlon Brando in the great On The Waterfront) had such a small part and it was also slightly underdeveloped. And the second flaw is I wish there were some flashbacks that could tell a little bit more of Superman and his relationship with Lois. Other than the flaws mentioned above, the film is worth watching and it is still fun, but in a way I walked away sad because the week before watching this film I had just watched another film called United 93. Yes, I wish we had a Superman and this is the closest we will ever get.",0,1,bondgirl6781,"Jun 30, 2006",

But my biggest problem is that Hollywood markets this violence to children. It is, after all, BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. I was so disgusted by the violence that I finally just walked out. There was a little girl about 8 or 9 that walked out when I did. She was shaking & almost in tears. I asked her if she was OK & she said she could not stand the violence. In this country, we are wondering why we are seeing generation after generation of desensitized & violent young people. Is it any wonder when we are responsible for force feeding them this violent trash? If you make a movie for kids, make it a kids' movie. This is vile. Not for children.",1,3,southernrains,"Jun 30, 2006",

6,Graceful return!!!,"Pretty impressive. A lot better than I originally thought. It's no Superman II but great on it's own. I had only one problem with the casting; Kate Bosworth. She's hot but she wouldn't have been my first choice to play Lois. She just looks way too young for the part. Brandon Routh however was very impressive despite this being only his first movie. Routh may share an uncanny resemblance to the late Christopher Reeve, but this Superman is his own. Kevin Spacey, to me, has never appeared in a bad role and does it again here as the diabolical Lex Luthor. Spacey's Luthor is the most evil and maniacal incarnation of the character yet. Gene Hackman's got nothing on him! This movie was not as good as Batman Begins or Spider-man 2 but I'd definitely rank it somewhere up there. Kudos to director Bryan Singer for taking Supes in the right direction!",0,1,Dangerous_Lee_Handsome,"Jun 30, 2006",

1,At least the opening credits were good.,"What better time to release this, than hot on the heels of Smallville? Why does Lois have a kid??? Because the whole hard working hottie single mom thing is in with Hollywood? How come Lois looks twenty years younger if this took place after the events in Superman II? Was Superman only seventeen when he disappeared for five years? He sure looks it! Why even bother with Ma Kent, a waste of a character? Lex Luthor AGAIN?!? Geez, the guy just never learns! And the twist near the end, painfully stupid and contrived. Of all the nerve! These are some of the burning questions that this utter borefest of two and half hours provides.At least some of the homages to the first two films were true to form. Thank God they kept the music intact too, no rap or emo! No sequels needed, please!",4,2,Chimera-5,"Jun 30, 2006",
10,So Amazing!,"I just saw the movie and I'm still in shock about how great it was! It was so wonderful that the entire audience clapped and cheered when it was over! I consider Roger Ebert's review of the movie as a day old turd left in the toilet. He just didn't get it. It's time for him to retire. He seemed to have wanted the movie to be like Superman 1. But it didn't need to be. The story was new, different and held it's own. I was crying during the opening and whenever I heard the music because I was so moved. This movie had the perfect tone/feeling and was so respectful to Chris Reeve's movies. I'm going to go see this movie a few more times! Throughout the movie, my husband and I just kept saying ""Wow!"" and ""So Cool!"" Brandon Routh did a wonderful job and the director did a phenomenal job. Go see this movie!",2,2,LilacDawn,"Jun 30, 2006",
1,Went in with low expectations and Superman flew well below them.,"Superman has undergone many television and movie incarnations and this movie instead of starting fresh new start with new and young audiences it continues the story set forth by Christopher Reeve. While watching the movie you'll notice if you're not familiar with the Superman Mythos a lot will not be explained, though it seems the film makers have counted that the audience will know at least the basics.There will surely be a few moments that will take your breath away or even put a smile on your face as you watch with childlike wonder. All that soon fades away as the movie drags on to a long lasting two and a half hours.As far as story goes, there could have definitely have been better obstacles placed before the Man of Steel. Ultimately you are comforted/annoyed by the fact nothing besides green rocks can harm him. If you're looking forward to seeing Superman face a challenge that takes a lot more than brawn to overcome, go watch some Smallville. Which is definitely a better portrayal of the Superman.In closing, only spend money on this film if you truly enjoy Superman in any shape or form. Even then though, don't forget to set your expectations a little lower than you'd might so you're not too disappointed.",1,2,SilverDagger00X,"Jun 30, 2006",

8,Why the World Needs Superman,"Coming from a Smallville perspective, I didn't think I would like this movie. But, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. Brian Singer delivers up a fresh and spectacular vision of Superman for the modern era. The characters of this movie are very well done (except for Lois Lane ~Kate Bosworth~). Brandon Routh gives a very human performance for his role of Clark Kent, the bumbling Daily Planet Reporter. He also does the Man of Steel justice and surprisingly, the costume didn't look goofy. Next is Kevin Spacey for the role of Lex Luthor. And I have to say, another job well done. The only person I didn't like in this movie is Lois Lane. Kate Bosworth just doesn't deliver the sarcastic lines that Margot Kidder (Superman I-IV) did. She just doesn't give any life to the character. And finally Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) gives a very hilarious performance. All in all, I give it a 8. The reason I'm not giving it a 10 is this. They dragged the movie out when they didn't need to. And also, I wish a villain was in it (besides Lex). But hey, I can't wait for a sequel!",0,1,Elrain,"Jun 30, 2006",

It's a very dull love story, and lacks any excitement!Please save yourself some money and wait for this on DVD. The effects aren't even worth paying money for!The acting was OK and he made a fine superman. I don't blame any of the actors for this pile of steaming crap.

8,Good movie for all,"After just viewing Hollywood's latest remake/comic book movie I have to say that it was pretty good. There was however, one thing that I didn't particularly like about the movie. What happened to the candy apple red colored cape and boots? There's nothing wrong with burgundy but the afore mentioned color is part of the cornerstone that is the identity of superman. I know, that's being a little picky but when I think of superman I think man of steel in bright red and blue. Enough complaining... the story and special effects were very well done. Routh was a good choice as the lead. Spacey's no Hackman but no one but Hackman could have done it better. It was a great Brian Singer effort...

6,Review of Superman Returns,"Superman Returns is about Superman who after a 5 year disappearance suddenly reaper's to the surprise of everyone in Metropolis. So where has Superman been all these years? Visiting his old planet and catching up with some site seeing of the graveyard that was once his former planet, how that takes 5 years to do is beyond me but any who...Just as he comes back, Clark Kent just happens to be back in town and needs a job. He then runs into Lois Lain only to find out that his Queen has moved on and is now engaged with a kid. Whats more is that Lex Luthor our famed evil doer is out of jail because Superman wasn't there to testify against him in court.Lex Luthor has somehow discovered Superman's fathers lair, and by talking to a computer of SUperman's father he is able to learn what Superman's weakness's are and how he can use the crystals in the lair combined with kryptonite to take the mighty Superman down.The downside to this somewhat simple story is that its awfully cheesy, its like watching a kids flick only its rated pg-13 probably cause of the cheesy scenes that Bryan Singer felt the need to show us in order to see how Superman works or something. The chemistry between Brandon Routh and Kate Boworth are no Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan from You've got mail. Frank Langella is like watching a dead person move, he has no life at all just shouts a lot at everyone. James Marsden I would have liked to have seen some more of, all we saw was him playing the kid and a joke or two with Lois. I mean come on! Lois is practically drooling over Superman and Richard doesn't even flinch its almost as if since we know from history that Lois and Superman are supposed to be together so why even bother making her boyfriend get jealous, I mean after all who would? And last but not least Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, I liked him. He was the only funny one and yet evil at the same time. I would have liked to have seen some more background on him though, like why was he in jail? What happened in the court room? I mean is everyone who watches this film supposed to have seen Superman from 1978? Not everyone has the luxury of doing that.So my final ruling is that if you want to see a kickass superhero movie, go see Spiderman 2, Batman Begins, or Daredevil. This movie was mediocre, now don't get me wrong it wasn't bad just not amazing.",2,5,valad2,"Jun 30, 2006",

Kind of like there is only one actor that could play Indiana Jones perfectly. I cried in the movie, but I knew I would because it's sad to not see Christopher Reeve.I think they found a good actor for this part, heck I'd jump in his arms. This new kid does a great job. I'm impressed with the changes in the tone of his voice when he is Kent and when he is Superman. The movie has original music and artwork from the first movies.

4,Should have been called stupid man,"I will admit up front that I went into this movie with a bias. I really didn't think much of the first four Superman movies. The first one was okay and second less than okay and the third and fourth were terrible. So when I saw the previews of this movie I moaned and I was right to moan. Where do I start? First this movie had the worst starring actor I have ever seen. I know that he was picked because of his resemblance to Christopher Reeves but he looked plastic, like an action figure, a real cartoon character, devoid of real facial expressions or emotions. His close ups were scary, really scary.Second the writing was just pitiful. Starting with the opening and then getting worse as the movie progressed. Bryan Singer gave Lois Lane selective amnesia and hoped that the rest of us had it too (concerning events from the other films). I guess he was trying to make X-men but Superman is not X-men and the dark, melodrama came off just plain laughable. This so-called savior Superman was all about personal accolades; he thrived on people loving him especially the women he should have left alone because she was already spoken for. And speaking of the whole Savior theme, I thought is was heavy handed and ridiculous. A real Savior does what he does cause it's right not because he wants everyone to have his name on their lips.Last, the whole ending was just plain stupid. Hello, where should Superman go to get healed, the fortress of solitude. Singer couldn't stop stealing from other movies i.e. The Matrix long enough to realize that. The people from DC comics should have given him a few of them to read. I just kept laughing during the whole supposed melodramatic ending, will he or won't he. Really I didn't care. Too bad that I already know there will be a sequel with the annoying child. I agree with Roger Ebert he looks like Damien, where were the 6's. 4/10",4,13,judywalker2,"Jun 30, 2006",

10,Christopher Reeve would be proud,"Long story short, what Bryan Singer did to Superman Returns is what Richard Donner did to Superman. He kept it true to the first 2 movies with some surprising plot twists.The movie was a bit slow for the first 10-15 minutes, out of 2 1/2 hours, but it really picked up into a must see movie. The story revolves around Superman returning after 5 years to Earth after trying to find his birth home, Krypton. And finding the world is different and desperately needs Superman. The story largely revolving around the love between Superman and Lois Lane was excellently portrayed. And of course Lex Luthor is back to his old tricks again from the 1978 movie.Brandon Routh did an excellent job succeeding the late Christopher Reeve. Not just as in appearance, but his portrayal of the Man of Steel. But for those who are critical about him being Superman, imagine if back in 1978 when Christopher Reeve was portraying the Man of Steel when George Reeves made him popular.As well as Kevin Spacy bringing Lex Luthor to life the way that Gene Hackman did. Another excellent successor. Kate Bosworth, not bad, she's no Margot Kidder, but not bad.Excellent visual effects, excellent story, Bryan Singer seems to be incapable of ruining Superman even if he tried. Definitely worth his time and effort.Review 17 months later....Not only this plays with the original Superman movies with Christopher Reeves, at least the first 2, but like Superman's 1 & 2, it plays with a part of Superman that in my opinion few realize he had. The man behind the Man of Steel. A reminder that Superman is more than someone who goes flying around and fights crime, but there is also a sentimental behind him. The man who loves Lois.I think that Superman Returns in terms of dependency is closely related to James Cameron's classic horror/sci-fi film ""Aliens,"" which as you know is actually a sequel to the Ridley Scott classic, ""Alien."" All you needed was about 5 minutes worth of the basics on Alien which then James Cameron was able to bring forth a classic that can stand on its own.You don't desperately need Superman's 1 & 2 for Superman Returns, but just the basics of Superman. It only has ""simple"" scenes and dialogs to connect it to the original, but all of it were effective enough so that everyone can understand Superman. As an example, when Lois said, ""I've done Superman before,"" Jimmy snorted humorously, indicating that she and Superman did indeed have, you know. You don't need to see Clark and Lois in bed from Superman 2.It is among the best things, like on Superman Returns, you don't need incredible amounts of detail for something so simple. If Superman Returns is dependent on anything, then it is the lore of Superman itself. The legend. Not doing a reboot saves us on more boring details, and have a ""stand alone"" sequel so you don't need the previous films to understand Superman.As well as the concept of the son is also excellent. Bring us to the man behind Superman. How he may be indeed the last survivor of the planet Krypton, but anyone who was orphaned, or lost family would understand. And returning to a world that has changed, like a soldier returning from a war.But one of the negatives about Superman Returns is the utter selfishness of the audience, especially the self-proclaimed experts. They believe that the World needs Superman to protect us from ourselves and clean up after ourselves so we don't have to. Or in English, it's Superman's problem, not ours. The world doesn't need Superman that way. The world needs Superman for his Symbology for good.When you get down to it, Superman can rarely get any better than this after Richard Donner at the helm.17 months ago, give Superman Returns ..... 9.5 out of 10. Today, give Superman Returns ..... 10/10.",0,2,NewDivide1701,"Jun 30, 2006",

10,Superman returns is a genius work by Bryan,"Faster than a speeding bullet… more powerful than a locomotive… Everyone knows the legend . Everyone knows the scene the crowd that lifts it's collective eyes to the sky at the distinctive whine of rushing wind and calls out .''Look up in the sky! It's a bird. It's a plane ..its Superman'' The greatest Superhero who inspired both kids and adults {American soldiers in combat in world war 2} for centuries is back in action on big screen after a long wait of 20 years. The wait was worth. Superman returns is a lavish spectacle which do contains the classic ingredients of Superman. Director Bryan singer combines the fascinating action , score and pathos with an intimate portrait of Superman. Singer finds a truly original approach to tell the story. Even if Superman is conceived on a doomed, distant planet, Superman is complete with all the desires , problems and idiosyncrasies that you'd find in any living, breathing individual. He is not like us, but in his heart he thinks he is. The bond that exists for Clark, with the people he loves and the world that adopted him. Brandon Routh repaid the faith shown in him by perfectly stepping in the boots of Reeves. Kevin Spacey stands apart as Lex Luthor and his is the most pleasing performance. The mood of the movie is bit gloomy anyway edge of the seat action lights it up. The world definitely needs more Superman movies.",1,2,narsimha_das,"Jun 30, 2006",

10,Very Entertaining Superhero Action Movie With Heart,"I saw it, and I loved it. I heard a little too much from naysayers before finally getting myself to the theater to see it, so I was apprehensive, but I had no reason to be. Bryan Singer is a fine director, good at pacing things, alternating the bullet bouncing off the superhero with the lump in the throat. He fills the two and a half hour running time with enough action to please action fans, prodigious and frequent use of Superman's many powers, a love story, and some genuine emotions from all the characters, including anonymous bystanders and Lex Luthor, the bad guy! I'm no Superman ignoramus, nor novice, having read about him with much gusto since about the time I learned to read at all. There is nothing in this movie that would be out of place in the Superman comics of the last few decades, and many an element you probably wouldn't see in the comics. Brandon Routh is a great Superman, fills the red boots with ease, and makes the role his own. I never thought anyone could follow Christopher Reeve; after all, I saw his version when I was nine years old, and he made quite an impression on me. Brandon does great things with the role, and I'd love to see him in many more Superman movies. Kate Bosworth was the biggest surprise, as I really expected her to be too young to pull it off, but I forgot about that as soon as the movie got underway. Her first scenes as Lois Lane are just bitchy enough to evoke the sassy star reporter even hardcore fans demand. Kevin Spacey was perfect as Lex Luthor, playing it a lot less wacky and more seriously. The effect was chillingly evil at times. The rest of the cast were great, with special credit going to Sam Huntington for being as realistically dorky as one could be without spoiling the Jimmy Olson character. He even wore a bow-tie. The special effects are phenomenal. The action is just as larger than life as it should be for Superman. The film is peppered with many references, including some very small subtle ones, to not only Supes' history but the DC Universe as well. All in all, a fun film that joins the ranks of superhero movies that get it right. Naysayers and nitpickers beware, even you may find yourself liking it. For a modern film at ten bucks for two and a half hours, you can't do better.",1,2,seltzer,"Jul 1, 2006",
5,"Great acting, weak story","There I was on my seat waiting for the title to roll, and once it started happening I was anticipating something like when I watched the first part of the movie when i was a kid, but sadly it was disappointment in the end, considering the high inputs. What surprised me was, the acting. I didn't expect Routh or Bosworth to do so well, but it turns out they did a terrific job. Kevin Spacey...there isn't a role in which he becomes the character, the character becomes him!! Fantastic work as usual. Every actor in the movie did a good job, though the direction of the movie can be told it is ""Bryanised"", i failed to understand why he would let his dream project go out of character. And there is more saving superman, than him saving the others......and the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane makes no sense.....no continuation from second part(as it claims to be), she is not supposed to remember they had a reltionship(remember?)

9,"At last, Superman Returns","When I was young there were a a few books, shows or movies that were incredibly special to me and that will always have a place in my heart: Dr Who, The Goodies, Star Wars, Narnia, LOTR and so on. These are my own personal myths, if you like, so it's been wonderful over the past few years to see the stories continue (or to see films made of them in the case of the books). Sometimes they were done well (Dr Who) and sometimes not so well (Star Wars) but I always got a real thrill at the start, when my hopes were still unspoiled, and those iconic tunes started to play. Even the first new Star Wars passed the test on that one - although I walked out disappointed, it was such a powerful moment when they cranked out the title theme after all those years of waiting. These are unforgettable moments for me - like when I finally saw Bowie play after waiting so many years for him to come out to Oz.The Superman movies (I never actually read the comics much) had a powerful impact on me as a child. I loved the first two so much - Christopher Reeve was fabulous, the effects were great and John William's superb score was as stirring as anything he ever did (Star Wars and Jaws included). Sure, looking back they seem a little hokey, but I will always love them, and that sequence where Superman catches the Helicopter and saves Lois Lane in the first movie is still one of my favourite movie moments of all time. It was Brilliantly conceived, choreographed, edited and scored. Wow.I remember being so excited when at the end of Superman II we were told that Superman ...would return in Superman III. I waited and waited - it just seemed to take forever to come out, leaving me with only my dreams and hopes of what it would be like. Unfortunately Superman III was a dud. It fell into the same traps that all the lesser superhero movies fall into. Superman IV was even worse - I was embarrassed to even watch it - so I just pretended they never happened (the same way I did with the 3rd and 4th Alien or the 3rd and 4th Batman movies).The years passed and I forgot about Superman. They made new Star Wars films, new Star Trek films. They made movie versions of The Lord of the Rings and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. They even managed to get the good Doctor back on the air, but when the new Superman Movie came out I must admit my prime motivation in seeing it was to share the experience with my girlfriend who is a big Superman fan because of Smallville (and dare I say it, Lois and Clark) but a funny thing happened...As the opening titles began and they rolled out the old Superman theme, it all of a sudden hit me how much I had missed Superman, and how much I hoped that they would get it right. I felt my cheeks moisten and my heart grow tight and I felt very much back in touch with that younger self, leaving me only with the question, ""can the rest of the film live up to this?"" Well, now that the film is done, it is very pleasant for me to say ""Yes! Bryan Singer got it right."" I can see the things that people have criticised about it, I know where they might feel that it falls down, but none of it bothered me at all. I was struck by the power of the myth, and love that Singer obviously had for the project. As he also didn't think much of the latter Superman Movies, they are totally ignored, meaning that finally, after all these years, I walked out of the cinema feeling like I had seen Superman III.",1,2,michael-broadstock,"Jul 1, 2006",

7,"Fighting for truth and justice, as the Americans say","I loved this film, not expecting it to be as good as it is, and still hit those targets that make it Superman. Lois is a difficult character to play and cast. She needs to straddle the divide of being canny as well as not noticing the resemblance of Kent to Superman. The casting of Bosworth for this role seemed perfect to me, partly because she is a good actress, but also because of her face, which resembles that of a girl I fell for over two decades ago. I never dated that girl (her choice), but over fifteen years hardly a day went by when I failed to think that my life might be made better were I to get her to change her mind. The upshot is I am totally sympathetic to her character :DSpacey is a brilliant actor. I don't like his politics, but I don't see his politics in his acting. As Lex, he personifies moody brilliance, flawed and evil genius. His callous disregard for his weak underlings made abundantly clear.Brandon's Superman is a good tribute to those past, and nicely brought into the 21st century. I sympathize with his indecision regarding Lois. Tristan Lake Leabu is believable in his role, and I look forward to his future work .. away from pianos.Nothing is missing from the legend, the story fits well with DC comic milieu and doesn't jar with Smallville. I look forward to a sequel .. ;)",0,1,ddbanddtt,"Jul 1, 2006",
10,jaw dropping and earth shattering (spoiler-free),"I knew I was in for a treat when the original Superman theme (composed by John Williams) started playing after some text explaining Superman's being on Earth. I went in to the theater with some high expectations and left the theater gitty as a Japanese 16 year old school-girl at a kawaii convention. The film far surpassed all expectations I had for it and converted me into a Superman fan. There are those who dislike Superman because of his so-called ""overpowered traits."" While it is true that he is invincible to anything but kryptonite, can fly, is faster than a speeding bullet, has freeze breath, heat vision, super strength, super hearing, x-ray vision, so on so-forth it is good to point out that Superman is Super-man, hence he's an all around powerful superhero. However that is not to say he doesn't have faults i.e. becomes useless when in contact with kryptonite, has the stupidest secret identity ever, and is a little overpowered. The fact is that Superman isn't a combat hero, he's a savior of the people, if he spent all his time fighting villains there wouldn't be time to save other people. Though he does have his share of villains, take Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) Superman's nemesis, the Joker to his Batman. Luthor wants to take over the world by producing SOMETHING that people would want and Superman has to stop that. The Story begins with Clark (Brandon Routh) coming back from searching for Krypton which scientist believed had been found. Superman comes back and makes a humongous splash back into fame. Afterwards he is back to juggling between saving people, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) (who also changed in the time Superman was gone (5 years)) Something weird is going on in Metropolis and even on the entire East Coast and Superman has to stop it, there's the story in a nutshell, a spoiler-free nutshell) The Cast, I thought, was excellent. As far as acting talent the cast pulls off the proper tones with no emotional screw-ups, slurs, awkwardness etc. my only problem being that Kal Penn from ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"" is one of Lex's henchmen and simply doesn't seem the type what-so-ever, however that look of confusion followed by his having no lines gives some comic relief allowing smart puns to be delivered by Lex and his female assistant/henchwoman Kitty. Lois feels pretty good as Lois, Superman is great as Superman simply because of the drastic change between clumsy dorky Clark Kent and heroic Superman, Kevin Spacey does a fantastic Luthor and leads you to actually feel that Lex is sadistic as a psychotic power hungry businessman can be. The musical score is composed by two composers, John Williams and John Ottman, Williams provides the absolutely stunning Superman theme that plays several times during the movie and Ottman provides the rest of the score which is also very well composed and all orchestral. Sound effects are spot on as rocks crumble in the distance and grow fainter or louder depending on distance. Summary is that if you're in the mood for something thats action but not all fighting and still has a solid story then go watch Superman. If you're waiting for the one Summer blockbuster to watch go see Superman. If you think all Superhero movies stink and this one is no exception go see Superman.

8,"Well, it has potential","This movie reminds me of the original Star Trek movie. Dead pan acting. However, the second came back to be fantastic. This is the hope I have for a second (or 6th) Superman if it's slated for a sequel.If there's one thing that made the first series of Superman's different with Margot and Christopher Reeve, it's that you cared about their characters because...well, they had character! Not to use such a cliché line, but Reeve had sparkle in his eye and he was fun, funny. Margot had energy which made her the fun busy body that Lois Lane had become associated with. But these new characters just walk around like life's no longer worth living. Bosworth's Lane was the worst in terms of depressing, something I wouldn't have associate with any of her previous characters. Routh's Superman needs to stop looking the part and really act it. He's got the look and voice down, but just needs to loosen up some. Spacey, I think, could be the one exception to this upset. His character was meant to be more monstrous and less funny and as always, he played it off perfectly. But that's Spacey, what about Frank Langella? A seasoned actor that played his part without much more appeal than the others, which tells me that this problem has nothing to do with their acting skills since these are good actors, than with the choice of the director. The same man who created House, M.D. and directed X-Men 2, which tells me that he knows how to give his characters personality. So this must have been a purposeful choice on his part, a choice I hope he reconsiders for a hopeful second, and I really would like to see a second. I haven't read any interviews yet, but it seemed like he was trying to reflect the seriousness of the times around us. If he was, stop. We have enough serious, we need something to lighten us up.Aside from the lack of personalities, another thing I'm hoping (believing) will change are the cliché scenes and plastic look Superman has at various times through the movie. I can even see the director saying,""OK, now pan in on him, closer...great, that will be our hero shot. And that. That one too."" Cliché scenes I suppose would be a given for a first time Superman director, so now that the first is over and the whole clicheness is out of his blood, he can get back to the storytelling and let the actors smile once in a while. The plastic look I will assume to be nothing but either too much makeup or bad SFX, though you wouldn't be able to tell that if you saw the action scenes. Amazing.Other than this, the story was pretty cool, not to mention intense. Routh gets to recite a couple of Brando's lines from the first movie which was a wonderfully touching moment. It was good to see Singer pay respect to the other movies by adding in certain lines or shots here and there which made for hilarity. A slight inconsistency with the whole exposure to Krypton but, oh well. Like I said, this new franchise has a lot of potential, so I'll look forward to a hopeful second.As for why I gave this an 8 when I had such a problem with the characters, because I still have an urge to go back and see it again. So yes, there are character problems but not enough to keep me away from it.",1,1,ACMcC24,"Jul 1, 2006",
10,Absolutely Awesome,"Superman Returns is one of the greatest films this year. It was full of action, drama, and the story line was done perfectly. The beginning of the movie was done very well with explaining both how learned of his powers and where he had been those previous five years. From right of the bat it was going to be a good movie. Although at times it could have used just a bit more action sequences, but even at those times it was still interesting and kept me wanting to see more. The cast did a good job portraying these already well-known characters. Watching Brandon Routh flying and saving people in the Superman costume, he just looked like what the ideal superman would be like. He had the ability to make this great comic book character that I had grown up with come to life. Kate Bosworth played Lois Lane with the same drive and hard workmanship that the character was all about. Kevin Spacey was just the perfect man for Lex Luthor. He was funny at parts, but you still were against him for what he was planning to do. To me the ending was hands down the best. You saw the world needing Superman, and not only the world, but also Louis. I think Bryan Singer was the best choice for directing this movie. He did a very good job with the story, actors, and bringing Superman back into our lives.",1,2,CTroy_fan,"Jul 1, 2006",

10,An impressive blend of action and contemplation,"It's hard being a good, decent, caring, self-sacrificial superhero in a cynical, jaded world such as ours.I love Superman and always have, simply because, at bottom, his story IS simple. Not over-complicated, not bi-polar, not angry-nutjob, such as people seem to want their superheroes to be, these days. It's the story of a beneficent being who uses his great power to help. No territorialism, such as our ""real"" men of power have. No agenda. Accessibility, fairness, love for humankind. What a concept! The downside of being the only one of his kind is very poignant in this movie. Even the Scrabble board spelled out ""alienation."" The man lives to help others, to the exclusion of his own emotional needs, and I was pleased and touched that the vulnerability, thoughtfulness, and loneliness were used to create a three-dimensional story.Initially, I thought, ""Oh, geez: a kid!""--a desperate and, usually negative, device in most things. In this case, however, aside from the unnecessary piano incident, it was completely appropriate and ended the film on a note of connection, belonging, having a place at last.Lose the cynicism, suspend the disbelief. This hero will touch you, not through anger, revenge, and violence, but with caring. He has sorrow in him, but not darkness. I like Wolverine, too, people: but I don't LOVE him. Superman is really one-of-a-kind in that regard.Insofar as having the next one entail the awful ""Death of Superman,"" with its heavy sci-fi aspects, the films should remain grounded, as they have been, on Earth, with people. That's what gives them their uniqueness, their greatness among hero-movies.",1,2,shanfan_14,"Jul 1, 2006",
9,Back to the good stuff!,"Superm Returns is not just the title but the premise for this visually and emotionally well done film. It has been around 20 years since the Man of Steel has been to the big screen, taking a needed break after two box office flops. I am very pleased to say the time was well spent and creates, in my opinion, the best comic based movie to date.On Earth astronomers discover what they believe are the remains of Krypton, the home of Superman. When he hears this Superman (Brandon Routh) is overcome with the desire to see if he really is the last survivor of the doomed planet. The film begins with his return from this trip finding a world five years old and moving on from the days of Superman.Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is free thanks to Superman not being there to testify at Lexs trial. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has a child, is engaged to a man named Richard (James Marsden), and is about to receive the Pulitzer for her article ""Why the World Doesn't need Superman"".Superman soon finds he is stuck in a world that he is once again unsure of where he fits. Is he capable of a normal existence or is he doomed to merely be the iconic untouchable hero? Emotions swing as he once again faces his one time love Lois and as he returns to the world he has given so much to save. Along with this Lex has another plan to gain power and control using Kryptonian technology to destroy the world as we know it creating it in Lex's image.The special FX in this film are more then amazing. The CGI is seamless and not once did I find my self saying, ""Wow, those effects are cool"" because I merely followed it as a part of the film. The flying moments are so perfect and create a graceful Superman in flight which the others were not able to do (not their fault they didn't have the tech).The acting was fantastic and I have to give immediate recognition to Brandon Routh for his great work. May biggest fear was that Routh would not follow the great job Reeves did in the first two Superman films. Routh did more then live up to it but created a continuing image of Superman. Spacey was fantastic at showing the frustrated brilliant arrogance of Lex. Lois Lane was given a lot of depth by Bosworth, who did a good job of showing Lanes strengths while also showing the hurt over Supermans sudden leaving.Bryan Singer, Michael Dougherty,and Dan Harris created an amazing story that pulls at our emotions while never boring us or making the film weak. As soon as the film was over I wanted to see more and would have gone through another 2 and half hours of it.Superman is once again the iconic hero of today.",0,1,restin_him,"Jul 1, 2006",
10,Superman is back!,"I have to say that this movie is by far the best movie I've seen all year. As a huge fan of the original Superman series, I definitely was not disappointed with this film at all. It really kept true to the original, and it really showed the capabilities that Superman possesses, thanks to the awesome computer technology! The whole cast was incredible! Brandon Routh is amazingly similar to Christopher Reeve, and I enjoyed seeing the same humour and humility in the character that Reeve portrayed in the original. It's too bad he wasn't alive to see it, I think he would've been blown away with this movie.Kevin Spacey was a great choice for Lex, and I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed with that casting choice. Kate Bosworth as Lois was also a great choice. And despite what people have said about this installment being a little more for ""chicks"", they were dead wrong. Superman has always loved Lois, and it wouldn't have been a Superman movie without that added to the plot. But they kept it genuine and realistic, and it definitely wasn't the main focus in the plot. But there's a few surprises there that will tickle any Superman fan.The plot was drawn out well. From the beginning of the movie until the end, there's enough action, and great dialogue to keep you wanting more. My exact words at the end of this movie was ""Let's watch this again""... and I'm going to. And I'll be the first in line to buy it on DVD when it comes out. Not to mention how they left it open for a second film... I'll be counting down for that too!! Basically, if you loved the original movies, you'll love this new installment 10 times more. I'm a huge comic book fan, and I was a huge Xmen movie fan... but after watching this movie not too long after the Xmen 3 film (which was AWESOME!!), Superman is now my new favourite comic book hero again. We went too long without Superman, and I now remember why I loved him so much growing up. Everyone should fall in love with Superman again, and get to this movie... you won't be disappointed!!",1,2,krissy_gemini81,"Jul 1, 2006",

It doesn't give the rest of us a single reason to give a damn.I love Kevin Spacey but his Lex Luther neither scared me nor made me crack more than a half hearted smile.Casting directors please move away from the little girls playing these supposedly smart tough women. Remember Kim Basinger in Batman, Margot Kidder in the original Superman or even Karen Allen in Raiders. Please remember these were women not pretty girls.",8,11,saint33,"Jul 1, 2006",
1,This is a horrible movie,"I don't know where to begin with how terrible Superman was. There were so many coincidences and plot holes that I was ready to walk out of the theater. Spoilers follow, if this film could be spoiled more. Superman returns, and so does Clark Kent, on the same day. No one notices? OK. And THE DAY he comes back to Metropolis is THE DAY that Lois Lane needs his help or she'll die and it's THE day that Lex causes the EMP? And that scenario with the shuttle was ridiculous. First of all, civilians would never be allowed on that kind of test flight. Secondly, if they couldn't release the latches OR shut down the engines (how convenient is THAT) then the shuttle would've torn away from the 747, not take it along for a ride at super-sonic speeds, and the 747 would've disintegrated. Superman manages to save the plane and it HAPPENS to land in the middle of a baseball field DURING a baseball game? Just too many things that happen in this movie that are too contrived. Another example is that we are supposed to believe that Lois Lane, in a about a day or two, managed to track down the source of the EMP that affected the Eastern seaboard to THE VERY HOUSE!!?? The gov't was not able to do this? So she goes to that UNGUARDED house with her kid in tow, and sees the yacht which is conveniently visible from the driveway and walks into it because its UNGUARDED, and when she realizes who it belongs to the yacht just HAPPENS to be pulling away from dock???? I wanted to puke. So they keep Lois Lane hostage NEXT TO A FAX, guarded by one guy (and from where did she get those coordinates?). Jeeez. And when she's missing, Clark and her fiancée try to guess her laptop's password and they get it on just the third try??? Amazing. And then they didn't even do anything with the laptop, which made the amazing password guess also irrelevant. When they are in the yacht there happens to arise a big piece of crystal that comes up at such a place in the big ocean to cut the yacht in half, and it breaks in half RIGHT at the door to the room they are in, so that when they look out the door's window they see sky -- how fortunate... how ... convenient for them. When Superman lands on the crystal island to take down Lex Luthor he is there for about 2 minutes before having his ass handed to him by Lex. OK, that makes sense because the island has kryptonite laced throughout it, but later Supes cuts the island out of the Earth and carries it slowly into space ??? What happened to it sapping his strength so quickly and completely? When we see him carrying it we also see kryptonite right by his head, so we know what SHOULD be happening. But conveniently he only loses his strength only AFTER he gets the job done, and then he falls into Central Park, conveniently. Without his strength he's as weak as a human, but he still survives reentry and the crash to Earth. In ""Austin Powers"" Dr Evil gets some laughs by trying to kill Austin without actually watching him die. And this movie does the same thing! It hauls out that tired villain cliché. Why didn't Lex cut his throat with that kryptonite knife???? Instead he just assumes Superman dies when he falls off the cliff. I guess he would've died if, conveniently, Cyclops didn't have a SEA PLANE ! ! ! And what was with the Christ symbolism? Superman falls in a Christ-like form back to earth after saving the planet; he sits in space and listens to calls for help (prayers); he gets the kryptonite knife (spear) in his side; a woman enters his hospital room (tomb) to find he's risen. I hate this movie with the passion of the Christ.This movie angered me not only for those contrivances, but also for what they did to Superman. They show him spying on Lois Lane's house like some creepy stalker. And they give him an illegitimate child? They are hardly honoring the character's integrity. Especially when they have dialog like ""Truth, honor, and all that stuff."" What about THE American WAY!!!! I guess it's not P.C. to be a proud American anymore, especially if this movie is to play well overseas. Another problem I had is that the leads are casted too young. We are supposed to believe that they have so much history and a 5 year old child, but the actress is only 23!!! These roles need older actors who show they have lived a few years beyond college so that when they say something happened ""a long time ago"" you really believe them. I can't remember being so annoyed, frustrated, and disappointed in a film.And in the interminable 2 1/2 hours Superman never even throws one punch.",24,24,mangorick,"Jul 1, 2006",
7,"Sufficient, But Can Not Challenge X-2: X-Men United.","To be honest, I expected a little bit more from Superman returns. Just a little, teeny tiny bit more.Like the original X-Men film, this film lays some groundwork for future character expansion and development. While the first X-Men movie had the luxury of explaining it's universe, characters, and secrets- Superman Returns does not. Most moviegoers are familiar with the basic tenets of Superman lore. Kryptonite, Lois Lane, The Daily Planet, Metropolis, etc.Superman returns hits the ground running, with these basic assumptions in mind.STRONG POINTS: Visually stunning. If you have the chance to see this film in I-MAX 3-D ( As I did), I recommend it highly. Although the entire film is not in 3-D, key action sequences are ( including the infamous space shuttle/ plane rescue sequence). Colors are sharp, vibrant, and striking. Kevin Spacey, although limited in screen time is menacing as Lex Luthor. Routh and Bosworth are effective. The use of original source material ( John Williams Superman March, Marlon Brando footage) is tasteful and unique.WEAK POINTS: What is it with Jimmey Olsen in this film?! I found him somewhat annoying and ultimately- forgettable. The movie is too long, and loses it's otherwise good pace towards the climactic center. More John Ottman would have been nice.Bryan Singer's magnum opus, X-2: X-Men United still clearly stands as Singer's strongest work with comic/superhero source material. Comparing Returns with X-2 is unfair, but justifiable on the ground that Returns is chronologically the 3rd film in the Superman Canon. A more apt comparison can be made once Return's sequel is released.This movie was fun, but not particularly great. 7/10.",0,1,dallasthecowboy,"Jul 1, 2006",
7,A refreshing revival of the classics,"When I saw Superman I of course had my doubts, being a fan of the originals. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.Superman returns after a five year trip to the remnants of the planet Kripton. Meanwhile, Lex Luther has been released from prison because Superman did not testify in court; apparently no one else saw him try to break California off into the ocean. Now Lex has stumbled upon the Fortress of Solitude and stolen Krytonian crystals capable of creating matter, and thats just what he plans to do. Lex Luther wants to create a new continent and sell it of a prime real estate. This sounds a bit convoluted, and it is. But that doesn't really matter because it seems to be a subplot in this movie. The main focus is on Superman and Lois Lane (who now has a sickly six year old with her boyfriend)'s relationship.The film does exactly what it should do. Show Superman parading throughout Metropolis (which looks a great deal like New York City and is even located in exactly the same spot). It follows the same formula as the other Superman films but differs from todays caped hero movies in a big way. From the moment he returns, people are happy to see him. For the past five years we've been watching movies about angsty superheroes who constantly debate whether what they're doing is right. Not in this movie, it's on the opposite spectrum from Spiderman 2, and rightfully so. This positive attitude is refreshing and helps the film work in a big way.So, basically, Superman returns does nothing but create a solid Superman movie, and that's all it should do. Now all we need to do it ride out a few unsuccessful sequels, wait another 30 years and we'll get yet another great Superman film.",1,2,movieman430,"Jul 1, 2006",
7,Superman Returns!!!!,"After seeing this movie, I have to say this is possibly one of the best comic book adaptations I have seen. In the SUPERMAN films, not including 3 or 4, I would say this is a worthy addition to the Superman franchise. This film is not in the same league as BATMAN BEGINS, but it has resurrected not only Warner Brothers, but also the DC Comics and more importantly, the Superman franchise. This movie is also an allegory of sorts, and you can see bits and pieces of it in the film. One bit of trivia that I am sure not everyone knows, is that Noel Neill, who played Lois Lane in the 1950's television series, plays a small part at the beginning of the film, also played young Lois Lane's mother in the first Superman film back in 1978. Brandon Routh was excellent as the Man Of Steel and Clark Kent. Kevin Spacey is excellent as Lex Luthor, and even though the chemistry is not totally there, the interaction between Kate Bosworth(Lois Lane) and Brandon Routh(Clark Kent/Superman) is pretty decent. Frank Langella portrayed the role of Daily Planet editor Perry White, and for the most part reminded me a lot of John Hamilton's version of the character. Don't know if I would have picked Kate Bosworth as my first choice to do Lois Lane, but although she didn't Lois Lane like Noel Niell or Margot Kidder, she was excellent in the portrayal of Lois Lane. Overall, It is good to see the Superman franchise resurrected by the folks over at Warner Brothers.",1,1,egan_shawnp,"Jul 1, 2006",

,Well done....beautifully directed...uplifting..,"I felt this movie was really well done and exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed the throwbacks to the original and I felt Brandon did a wonderful job of capturing the true spirit of Superman. Kevin Spacey was also amazing as the villainous Lex Luthor, and I felt he showed a more evil aspect that was not given as much by Gene Hackman. I will say seeing this movie more than once influenced my thoughts because I was able to actually sit and take everything in as with the first night, I had to get past all the cheers and clapping:-) I enjoy that too though, because it does get you excited for a film. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job directing and the plane scene was amazing. I think a new series has been born.",0,1,phantomsgirl25,"Jul 1, 2006",
9,Superman is back,"I certainly had my perception of what this movie would be what with the trailers and the critics reviews. However, I was pleasantly surprised that Mr. Routh and Mr. Singer changed my perception and answered the critics. Superman is back and is in it for the long haul.Perception 1: Routh is too skinny. Christopher Reeves looked the part. My perception of what the ""man of steel"" should look like began forming from DC Comics in the mid 50s. C. Reeves looked ""more"" like the part than his 50/60s TV counterpart, and C. Reeves' attitude was always one of adult mode or nurturing parent. He rarely played the critical parent, except for a couple of well placed zingers.Routh's poise and pose overcame his lack of bulk and met the requirements. I looked until the end of the movie for a chink in Brandon's armor, but happily, it didn't come. When I learned that Routh spent much time investing in the look, hiring consultants to help him with that process, it made sense, and, in my opinion, paid off.Perception 2: Routh could not make the transition to Superman a discernible difference and make it fun.Without giving the store away Mr. Singer helps here. However, I must say I felt that the role of Kent was underplayed. Then, this movie gives us more flying and therefore more Superman. In that, it is extremely entertaining. There is one transition scene which more than makes up for the fun part.Perception 3: The special affects would bring us nothing new. The effects would not be updated to twenty years of advancement in technology.Some of the special effects were eye-popping, especially at the beginning of the movie. The script played to those effects, and Mr. Singer didn't miss too much in that regard. The best effect (without disclosing too much)? Making Routh look good. The flying sequences were so good it was like comparing a high-end automobile with low tolerance levels in the lines to an automobile where the doors don't line up. Another check had to be the contrast and lighting of the movie. This one gave us enough sunshine shots, and dark shots were resolutions did not make the people look too animated. Let's be blunt, all movies still have a way to go in this category. At least equal to Spiderman in my opinion.Summarily, this is a DVD buy, and I can't wait for the next Routh episode. Finding out what a Superman nut Routh is makes it all the more interesting to me.",0,1,obrofta,"Jul 1, 2006",

Who thought Kevin Spacey could look like a good Lex Luthor? Not me. And Brandon Routh (Superman) looked so much like the original Superman, Christopher Reeve. The plot was pretty well done. There wasn't a moment in the movie where you weren't on the tip of your seat. They better make a second movie... or should I say 6th?",1,2,steeped,"Jul 1, 2006",
10,And I thought Spider Man 2 was the best... I was wrong...,"In 2004 when Spider Man 2 came out I thought it was the best super hero movie I have ever seen. So the comic book future of films was wide open. I heard this was coming out in 07 shortly after Spider Man 2 was released, so I thought about how cool Superman would look after seeing the SFX dished out in SPider Man 2. So anyways, I sat around and I got movies like Constantine, which kinda sucked, but it was watchable. Then we got Elektra, which I thought was a little better than Daredevil. BUt from there I expected Marvel to break through with Fantastic Four. DC then shells out Batman Begins, which was rather well done. It looked great on the screen. Fantastic FOur came out and I figured Marvel was gonna blow DC away, I was wrong. THat movie just could not do it... X Men The Last Stand was next for Marvel. Would it make it? NO! It sucked as well! Marvel has already lost their credibility since they only have Spider Man and Punisher. What? The Punisher kicked ass! Anyways, Superman came around and i thought it was gonna suck because he had no villain. I watched the movie and thought it was going to be sub par, but I was wrong. Normally when I go to Drive ins I don't pay much attention to movies, but Superman Returns was the first real movie that actual had me on the edge of my seat since, well, ever. The Shuttle Rescue was impressive, it was worth the admission. I didn't get to finish this movie though, we had to leave early, but I'll tell you about how cool it was.Acting. It gets better and better. It had it's cheesy points, but that was supposed to be like the comic books. Brandon Routh has already been able to overcome his predecessors with the Superman Image, so I liked it. I'm glad Bryan Synger dropped out of X Men The Last Stand because he put that dark vigilante style into this movie.Plot. It did nice picking up after the first five movies, and it was seamless to me because I wasn't really a big fan of the first five movies. This story shows that Lex Luthor really can come up with an evil plan after all. His plan in this movie is to use a crystal that can cause blackouts and then he will soon flood the planet and make his own continent to like on. Yeah, it's dark as hell! His actions in this movie actually placed me on Superman's side because when I see plots in some movies, I always say, ""Ah screw it, let 'em die already."" I was rooting for Doc Ock in Spider Man 2. But that's as much as I can say on that.Action. The action scenes alone in this movie was enough to pull me in. Superman still has that, ""nobody dies while I'm around"" type of character, which is good. I can't really spoil them, but let's just say they are amazing.Overall, I'd have to say that Superman has finally brought faith into DC and I'm going to be awaiting a possible sequel and another DC movie to come out. I also am awaiting Spider Man 3. And if you don't like Superman, there's a Spider Man 3 trailer in the beginning. Wait... Watch this movie, now.

6,Good but not great,"Like all others that were waiting for the new Superman movie to come out, I was definitely excited. The previews really had my hopes set high. I like the fact that the third and fourth installments were put aside so this movie wasn't plagued by those awful sequels. With that said, I was disappointed. I liked the movie, but I didn't love it. With the success of the TV show smallville, I guess I used that as a basis of comparison. Routh did an excellent job, it was like seeing Reeves younger and stronger. Spacey played an excellent Lex Luther as well. Bosworth did lose it for me as Lois, I just did not feel that she was Lois Lane. I think that she just cannot pull off that particular personality. Coming back around, it was definitely a good movie. What kept it from soaring was the length of the movie. It started out very fast paced, then it suddenly slowed down in the middle. Although it picked back up towards the end, I couldn't help but to check my watch to see when it would end. The special effects were well done, but my girlfriend did comment on some of the flying scenes looking off. I unfortunately guessed the movie's big surprise early on, so I lost the ""no way"" factor when they announced it. I recommend before seeing this movie that you lower your expectations. Though it will look great after watching the first two movies, see this during a matinée to save a couple bucks. In short it is a good movie, but not a great one. I hope the next movie picks up the slack a little because I still plan to give this franchise another chance.",0,0,leopisces,"Jul 1, 2006",

Unfortunately, i found myself watching the move, being barely interested, and wishing I was somewhere else.. I truly disliked the plot. It was uninteresting. The one or two action scenes were fine, but really there weren't enough of them to get the blood flowing. The movie was 30-45 minutes too long for what it had to offer..(a similar fault to movies like ""Kong"" and ""The Hulk."" Also, the movie was very slow and actually boring in many parts.. The acting was okay.. nothing special, but it was OK. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, unless they are a big Superman fan, in which case they have already seen it.. ha ha.

1,A Joyless Return       *Spoilers*,"Singer has turned SR into a sappy, joyless soap opera, using the greatest mainstays in soaps: a scorned woman and questioning a child's paternity. At the end of ""Superman II,"" after his powers are returned he says he'll never leave again. He's also known as someone who never lies, established in first film, so how is it that all of that is disregarded? The dutiful Superman would never leave his adoptive home planet unguarded for any length of time, much less five years and after the events of SII. Superman is an alien from another planet with a different DNA and molecular structure, so how can the kid be his? Even if they expect us to buy that Clark was human in SII when he slept with Lois, how would the kid still be born with abilities? You can't have it both ways. If Superman is an alien which he is, there's just no way he can procreate with a human. The molecular chamber only took his powers away. If they're now saying he was somehow turned human then there's no way the kid should be superhuman. Most importantly, why would Singer want to undercut the significance of the main character by saddling him with a kid with similar powers. Not only that, Superman is now more grounded, and less unique. What is the point to being Superman? There's a lot of drama that can be had from his feeling like an outsider and trying to find his place in his adoptive society. Imagine a god that may feel inadequate, unable to give Lois what another man could, that he can do almost anything except have a child. Or even the responsibility of the public seeing him as a god and all that entails. What's the sequel going to be, a live-action version of ""The Incredibles""? On the technical side, the effects for the most part are proficient CGI. Even Superman himself in some scenes, and his fluttering cape in others. Although like in the Spider-man movies, the CGI rendered character is never really convincing. It's like watching a video game avatar. I read or heard there were a lot of practical effects but that's not really the case. The bullet-time effects have been done and seem dated. None of that matters because the film has a pall over it where one can barely see what's going on. The cinematography is dark. The whole movie, even in the daytime has an overcast, murky feel to it. The sound was great, though.Brandon Routh had very little choice but to mimic Reeve's performances. In this he was just preprogrammed, bringing nothing of his own charisma to the roles. The suit is fine but the textured plastic appliques reminded me of Spider-man's quirky suit. Bosworth's performance is generic. Her Lois is in name only. She was miscast much like Katie Holmes in ""Batman Begins"", much too young for what the pivotal role calls for. Bosworth seems in a daze the whole time. Her chemistry with Routh is dry. Reeve and Kidder were a delight when they were together as both Lois and Clark and especially as Superman. Their chemistry was almost magical. Luthor's plan is idiotic and nonsensical. It doesn't make him look smart which is a key component of his character. Spacey is fine but it seems he's in a different movie playing by himself. Parker Posey is at least sympathetic, but I have to ask myself why she would want to be in Lex' presence when she's clearly not impressed by anything he does. Is she in it for the money or just all the free cute dogs she can have? The fact that his henchmen are silent is eerie. It didn't make sense that they are so lifeless and give Spacey almost nothing to play off of. The movie just gets weird with an overextended ending and too many overt Christ/resurrection references, whereas Donner kept any Christ references almost subliminal. This Supes is strange because he almost appears to be impressed with his own celebrity, gazing at the cheering crowds and almost proud of his TV coverage, whereas Reeve's Superman seemed to find the attention curious. His spying on Lois and Richard is creepy. Superman doesn't need to spy on his loved ones, he's too EARNEST for that. Just because you could know everything doesn't mean you should.Singer does succeed in showing that even a human can be super, i.e. Richard rescuing his family. That is lovely. It's a perfect example of how action can service the story. It exemplifies how committed to Lois and their child he really is. Singer doesn't succeed in engaging us with the action scenes. I sat there looking at them but not in awe of them. It's just Superman doing everything I know he can do. There is no inventive or interesting twist to anything he does, like when Superman in the first film became part of the tracks so that the train wouldn't derail, or his creating the dam before the waters can wipe out a town. Metropolis has no character, very much like Bosworth's Lane, in name only. There is no hustle and bustle, vibrancy or any technological advances that might make it unique. Although Donner substituted NYC for Metropolis, you knew in the back of your mind it was the crossroads of the world where Superman would exist.Clearly, Singer has a love for the original films on the surface, but he should have mined more of the source material - the comics, as Donner did for inspiration. Donner's films were joyful, even inspirational. Singer's stands as a reverent monument to the first films but just like a museum or church where you gaze at it respectfully with clasped hands in front of you afraid to touch anything. Well, we already got a sneak preview of the title of the sequel, ""Superman Lives"". Too bad he doesn't live in this one.",5,5,IMDbigONE,"Jul 1, 2006",
9,Great Superman! (no real spoilers),"Now I might not have grown up with the older Superman movies, but I have seen all four of them many many times. I have also seen about 95% of all the Justice League episodes and even a bunch of ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" and ""Adventures of Superman."" I enjoyed every bit of this movie. Some people said it was way too long, it didn't get to the evil stuff with Lex Luthor fast enough, and that there was no action. Did we not forget the first Superman movie? Lex Luthor and Superman do not appear together until 1h56m into the movie when the movie was 2h31m long! No action!? There was really no action in the first Superman movie. All we watched was Superman deal with a few bad guys, he chased after two missiles, and then reversed time. Where in Superman Returns, by comparison, there is way much more. So if you are going to complain about these facts about Superman Returns, you cant turn an eye from your ""precious"" 1978 Superman movie.The special effects and sound were amazing. Even with all the stuff Superman did in the movie, there wasn't any time where the scene seemed fake. It made you feel that everything you saw was 90-100% real and it made you almost feel as if we lived in a Superman world.The story was great. It reminded me of the 1978 Superman movie. It does take some time before all the evil plot kicks in, just like in the 1978 movie, but this is good because the the movie gives you an insight into who Superman really is and why does he do what he does. The movie does a great job developing the character of Superman, which is needed in a movie like this so that all the new viewers can understand a man like Superman. Even though this movie is seen as ""Superman 2.5"" you need to refresh everyone with the characters, just like in Batman Begins. I am every pleased with Superman Returns and I can not wait for other installments. I think we need to see Doomsday, Brainiac, or any of the other powerful villains to challenge Superman in the next movie. Superman Returns, like the first movie, does lack the action you would really want to see Superman in, but this can be made up by introducing other villains then Lex Luthor (even though he is the only true villain of Superman).",0,2,DamirithExtrieth,"Jul 1, 2006",

10,Perfect,"This movie is nothing more than PERFECT. From the beginning to the very last image. Sure Brandon Routh acts a little like Christopher Reeves, but that's what I was expecting. Reeves had also done a perfect job portraying The Man of Steel. Changing that would have been a terrible idea. Superman Returns is by far the best I've seen this year. It has a great story line with good controlled action. Not only did the visual effects seem natural in this movie, but also added dept to the already great storyline. Any who would think different are not Superman Movie (Not Comic Books) Fans. This is a movie I will go back for more. And the DVD better be backed with great extra's.",2,3,rlacroix-1,"Jul 1, 2006",
10,"Bravo, Brian Singer, et. al.","Why did Brian Singer leave a sure fire hit in X3??? In a word, Superman!!! Actually, two words in Superman Returns.It's an unbelievably fabulous movie, and the great bonus is I got to see it in Imax 3D. Viewers expecting a whole lot of action might be disappointed, but this movie balances action, a little comedy and romance. Brian Singer and company deserve a big hand for this fine piece of work.The use of Brandon Routh (who amazingly sounds like Christopher Reeve at times with that slightly nasal voice), Kevin Spacey (Perfect antagonist acting), and Kate Bosworth are very well done. Although the main protagonists (Routh and Bosworth) seem a tad young to continue Superman II (20 years ago, more or less) plus 5 years down the line, I really didn't mind. THe music, using John Williams' original score, was a brilliant touch, bringing nostalgia to the viewers of the Christopher Reeve stories, plus making relevant its excitement to the current Superman generation.With modern movie technology being where it is now, the effects and realism of Superman Returns are unreal. (I can't wait to see Spiderman 3) That the story is well balanced (not like X-Men 3 which seemed too garbled with its many story lines) is a big bonus (kinda like Spidey 2).I totally can't wait for the sequel!

8,"Superman Returns, Upgrades and even Reprises","""They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way."" And the words of Jor-El via Marlon Brando, both spoken from beyond the grave, can not only be referring to the human race, but also director Bryan Singer and his able contingent of writers and fellow producers who delivered a Superman film the likes of which has never been seen – although one could easily ponder that if Dick Donner had access to modern-day technology, this would have been his film as well. From the ground up, Superman Returns flies. It picks up, in case you haven't heard, five or so years after the events chronicled in Superman II. Lex Luthor is out of jail and eager to pickup on a real estate scheme similar to his plan in the original Superman: The Movie but this one is of planetary proportions. As a result, Singer and screenwriters Michael Doughtery and Dan Harris wisely move away from bringing in a comicbook-inspired super-baddie to rough up our hero and instead focus on Luthor's hatred of a ""god in blue tights"" revolving much of the main fight in a (Super)man vs. nature spectacle. Whereas the main star of the film is probably the extensive but-brilliantly-done CG F/X, most of the actors step up to bat as well. Brandon Routh's Reeve-esquire performance highlights his ability to be both heroic and commanding as well as stammering and sheepish while performing as the titular bespectacled civilian identity. Two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey channels Gene Hackman and plays up Luthor's sharp smile conning the audience one second and killing them the next. Even Frank Langella's Perry White seems comfortable. Only Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane, although adequate enough, seems to lack that passionate fire that makes Lane such a compelling character.The film is filled with Breakfast of Champions scenes and action staged to please both the general audience and fanboys as well. For those who care, be sure to take note of the nods to Action Comics #1 (1938), Man Of Steel (1986) and a very clever re-cap of Superman's first two films all told via Luthor's model train room. Unfortunately, not even this film is perfect as the results of the finale are dealt with in a depressing manner that not only spoil the mood but also the tempo of the film. Then there is the sub-plot dealing with the mysterious lineage of Lois' son that perhaps boldly goes into territory that even the much-more brazen monthly comics have yet to go. The pondering of this question really only proves that maybe those comics are best left to such exploration allowing the movies to grow as fantastical companion pieces. Spider-Man's Sam Raimi might be only director to fully grasp this concept. Until, at least, Christopher Nolan creates another Batman film.As certain as believing that a man can fly, Singer crafts a tale full of magic and wonder that almost makes the 20-year wait manageable – as long as Singer's follow-up appears faster, than say, a speeding bullet.",121,115,joker-4,"Jul 1, 2006",
8,It gets better when you see it second time...,"As a long time Superman fan, I have waited for this movie for a long time. Late Chris Reeve defined the Superman role in 1978 movie, Superman: The Movie and Brandon Routh, an unknown as C. Reeve was before S:TM, was a big question mark for me. After seeing the movie, I'm delighted to say that B. Routh has met my expectations, even exceeded them in some parts (e.g. his Clark Kent portrayal). Bryan Singer, the director of this movie, once again hit the bulls-eye in casting an unknown and creating a star from him.Casting of Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was another subject questioned in forums. 23-year-old actress might seem too young for this role. However, she pulls a quite satisfactory Lois Lane portrayal. She is not the best Lois Lane but she has the potential to be in the sequels.Kevin Spacey was, also good in his portrayal of Lex Luthor, arch-nemesis of Superman. He is not Gene Hackman in S:TM and Superman II. This Lex Luthor is really a dark villain with just right amount of comedic side. Parker Posey is Lex's sidekick, Kitty Kowalski, and she is just great in her role. However, the best in supporting cast is Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen, followed by James Marsden as close second. I should also mention that the kid in this movie, Tristan Lake Leabu as Jason White, is surprisingly good (at least it is surprising to me). Eva Saint Marie was a delight to watch as Martha Kent. I wish she had more screen time. Frank Langella is a different, non-cliché Perry White.One interesting note to this movie is it gets better the second time. I saw it in a regular theatre and I thought it was good but not great. When I saw it in an IMAX theatre in 3D, I thought this movie may very well be really great. It's not just the 3D parts because you don't need to see it in 3D to appreciate the visual side of this movie. What I'm talking about is the overall story of this movie. It is touching, it is funny, it's heartbreaking, and it is hope-inspiring.My only problem was the pacing of the movie. That's the reason I gave 9/10. Sometimes it felt it was rushed. I can understand why it was like that. However, I cannot help but think that this movie should have been longer. This is ironic because the movie is a long one as is (2 hours and 33 minutes). I hope WB will release an extended version on DVD.I definitely recommend seeing it.",4,9,ziusudra,"Jul 1, 2006",

8,A Good (Re)start,"**Possible Spoilers Ahead** First and foremost- thank God this did not fall into the hands of ""McG"", Tim Burton, or Nicholas Cage.I can completely understand what the director was doing with this picture. Picking up and continuing a franchise that was dropped (and badly bruised) almost twenty years ago is a risky move. The fact that Singer decided to carry on the story is admirable and his efforts show very well in this picture. Keep in mind the events of Superman III and IV have been ignored.One does not have to see Superman I & II to completely understand Returns, but it does help. Having grown up with those movies, I found myself often having ""Oh yeah..."" moments and having to think back (especially to Superman II) to remember what led up to the events on screen.Singer obviously studied and admired Donner's original and the ""tips of the hat"" that happen in this movie (especially the opening credits, set designs, Brando footage, and that closing shot just before the credits roll) are an excellent touch.The story is a bit slow at times and the rationality of having a ""Super-Kid"" is the only thing that I really question. I understand it is the logical conclusion of Lois and Clark's love scene in Superman II, but, I hope it is not what causes this re-start to falter.See it. Much like Singer's first X-Men it's not perfect, but it is worth your time and money.",0,1,70shoe,"Jul 1, 2006",
10,Keep Returning Superman!,"Superman Returns left me wanting more. My husband and I both loved it and thought Brandon Roush was amazing. I had predisposition myself not liking the new Man of Steel, miscast...I was so wrong (I don't admit being wrong much)! I can't think of anyone else to play the new Superman now that I've seen him in the film. The subtle reactions, the confidence in the suit, the gentleness in his emotions, not to omit the solid action, there are many reasons for our renewed Supes lurve (blue contacts helped the image, too). Now that Clark Kent has been reintroduced to us, I feel like a sequel could only be better (Star Wars sequels and alike, once you get the introduction of the first movie in, then the character explorations and plot possibilities can really dive into it more).Definitely, the best movie of the year. I'm suspecting Pirates and Supes will tie as our favorites for different feel good reasons.I'm making the best out of the Kate B casting for Lois, but Superman (aka Clark)/Lois make it work, I want a sequel with more of their storyline/interaction, and I mean more! I left the theater wanting a movie just about them (with bullet proof & flying action of course), which is praise to their chemistry and Bryan Singer's (and dynamic duo scribes) storyline. The Special Effects were visually stimulating, the action was heroic, the actors played to their characters, the Lex and his crew were fun to see bad, the sad parts got me more hooked in the flick and my hero rather than, well, be overly sad, and the love story (aka triangle) probably made this Superman movie more addicting. (No offense to Richard, I have already written the first sequel in my mind without you) Bravo for honoring so much of the 1978 & 1980 flicks (as well as TV cameos). We left the theater saying, ""That was a good ol' fashion movie!"" and Christopher Reeves should have been proud of Brandon's approach. Finally, a good (superhero) guy in a good (everbody sleeps safe with the World's guardian angel looking after them) movie we can feel good about (simple enjoyment).

The movie also does a good job of bringing depth to the Superman/Lois relationship with a new spin I won't give away. Overall director Bryan Singer keeps it real as far as making us believe Superman flew right out of the comic book pages and onto the big screen. As for criticizing Routh for mimicking Reeve's, can you really blame the guy? Reeve's performance was perfection so Routh was smart to have used it as a reference rather than to ignore what we all knew and love. The complaints are trivial because Singer gives us depth to Superman and his struggle to not to feel alone in the universe. It's something every one of us can relate to.

7,"Superman Returns, but darkly.","It's rather surprising that fans - or is it fanatics - of the religious right haven't picketed SUPERMAN RETURNS yet. While I have not read the other IMDb.com reviews of this film I would find it hard to believe that others haven't noticed the obvious similarity between Superman and Christ in this film. Superman doesn't only ""fly"" in this movie, he often slowly ""descends"" and ""ascends"" into the heavens. He can also be seen assuming a crucifixion-like pose as he floats in space and absorbs the healing rays of the sun. I thought these special effects were marvelous, especially the scene of SUPERMAN flying through the dark over Gotham.What did not enhance the film was the dark cinematography and the far-out sub-plot involving, apparently, crystallography. What we really want to see in a Superman film is the bright red and blue colors of his costume, lots of naive characters, and absolute moral unambiguity. However, this film is one of densely muted colors, complicated characters, and moral equivocacy. Those traits might be fine in another film, but not for SUPERMAN.I'm way past childhood, but I think that children would not especially enjoy this movie. Kids enjoy seeing movies where good triumphs over evil, not a film where we are left to ponder the human condition. That they can get from real life.As for the players, a subdued story line makes for subdued performances. Nevertheless, Kevin Spacy did a fine job - better than Gene Hackman's portrayal, in fact - in the role of Lex Luthor. Everyone else was just OK, which is what this movie demanded.

8,Best Superhero Movie in a While & Superman is Jesus,"Superman is a character you just can't help but love and that's why his movies are always a joy to watch. Superman is the ultimate superhero; he has all the powers we wish we had. It feels great to watch Superman stand up to the crooks and know that they stand no chance at all. When the innocent are in danger you know Superman will come and save them, but you still cheer inside hoping for success. When he hurts we feel bad. When he does save the day you really want to applaud. We see hope; Superman is our savior. It's all a movie but we want some one like this god to look up to and rely on in real life. We want good to prevail over evil! The good guys all ways win. That's what Superman Returns gives us.It's enjoying and entertaining because everyone is familiar with Superman and we want to see him in action. The effects are awesome which show off the Man of Steel's absolute power. But unlike some other super hero movies Superman isn't just about the special effects. It concentrates on character too.It mostly concentrates on the romance between Lois Lane and Superman, and partly because of Kevin Spacey's superb acting we get to see Lex Luthor's realistic evilness and more of his character. There's also a surprise revelation with a certain character and I don't even know if it was ever part of the comics, but this revelation does add to the development of the characters. The story was nothing spectacular. Evil = greed and power. Good = unselfish Again it was mostly the character that drives the story, like most super hero filmsSpeaking of characters the casting was excellent, for the most part actually. Brandon looks like Superman (& like Christopher Reeve) ; he also plays a well as Clark Kent and Spacey of course plays a great Lex Luther. However I've never pictured Lois Lane as Kate Bosworth. She acted well, but I don't think they concentrated on getting an actress that looked like Lois as much as they did to get the right actor for Superman.Aside from character the movie contained some reverences to the son of God. In movies, aliens always seem to be connected to Jesus; for example E.T. Superman isn't human remember; he's from Krypton. You'll notice these Jesus references when you see them.""I'm always around"" ""You wrote that the world doesn't need a savior, but every day I hear people crying for one""Along with Christian references you might also catch a couple sexual innuendos. It is PG-13Let's see, negative aspects. The movie did seem a little too long, just a bit. It clocked around 2hrs 30 min. It was probably because there were many moments when it could have ended but then it continued. It was sill a good movie on the whole.There's shock, suspense, thrill and action. It's fun to watch and it's actually a good superhero movie. It's even comparable to Spider-Man, which is one of my favorite superhero movies ever; Spider-Man being my favorite comic hero doesn't hurt that opinion. Yet, now I'm starting to like Superman a lot more. Let's just wait till Spidey 3Superman Returns is probably the best movie out there right now aside form The Devil Wears…, which I haven't yet seen.

It is visually stunning and takes you on a emotional roller-coaster right from the opening sequence to the end credits. I thought the cast and acting were superb and the selection of Brandon Routh to portray our hero has been the correct one. I would personally like to thank everyone involved in making this movie.

The most original idea in the film involves the Superman costume, which looks pretty spiffy. The technical film-making skills on display are amazing. Which it's SUPPOSED to be, given the budget and talent involved. The big problem: Superman is supposed to be larger than life, and heroic. Instead he gets his face rubbed in the dirt by nameless characters, spends time in the hospital, has a beer with Jimmy Olsen, has romantic/family problems well-suited to daytime TV, and thank god for the modern comic brilliance; he burps. Some of this is in service to the plot, and some of it is in an attempt to make Supes more of an everyman. It makes for a dull movie with no real sense of adventure or joy. Longing to be human and the attendant loss of power was addressed with humor and efficiency in Superman II. These are two qualities Superman Returns would have done well to emulate, as the gravity and humorlessness of this turgid film proves inescapable. One of my favorite things about Superman is that he's not human. He is NOT one of us. He was in fact sent to help us. I'm glad that he's not conflicted about this role at least, or the film might have proved to break the three-hour barrier.",1,1,pasfroid,"Jul 1, 2006",

4,Man of Steel...Man of Blah,"Superman Returns was boring to watch. Certainly, the special effects were amazing, but that's all the movie had to offer. The performances were weak. The story was painfully dull.I would think that if you were relaunching a cherished franchise, absent from the silver screen for about nineteen years, you would want the film to be as big and epic as possible. Why then are we offered this rough draft of a very uninteresting story? Superman vs Lex...it's been done before, twice. Lex threatening humanity over a real estate venture; didn't that happen in the first movie?????????? A review of this movie cannot be done without taking a hard look at the performance of its leading actor, and the latest incarnation of the Man of Steel, Brandon Routh.I went to Superman Returns with the best of intentions. I tried to tune out the performance of Christopher Reeve and give Brandon Routh a fighting chance at winning me over. Sadly, Routh failed.I feel for Brandon Routh, I really do. What a horrible and insurmountable task he had placed before him. I mean to millions of fans Christopher Reeve was Superman and, unfortunately, comparisons between Reeve and all that come after him are inevitable. I'm sure Christopher Reeve had the same problem when he first donned the cape and boots. He played under the shadow of George Reeves, the Superman before him.As I watched this new Superman save the day, again and again, I noticed that something was missing. I mean Routh looks like Superman, sort of, he had the costume and the special effects. However, something fundamental was missing. Then it hit me...this Superman shows almost no emotion whatsoever. The little nuances that made me see the previous incarnation as a three dimensional, flesh and blood being were absent. This Superman, aside from posing heroically, simply doesn't know HOW to be Superman. He plays the character as an arch-type rather than as a person.However, unlike Routh, Reeve owned his version of Superman. He played the character with a passion that made him interesting to watch. His performance showed no sign of hesitation or fear. Whatever Reeve was feeling on the inside is anyone's guess.Reeve's Superman, at least in the first two films, expressed earth shattering anger, stoic optimism, bashful infatuation and mortal fear. Yes, he possessed God like abilities but he still hurt and felt like an ordinary man.Routh's Superman simply goes through the motions. There is no vigor or zest for what he is....a hero.So, for now, I'm still waiting for Superman to return.",4,4,donxavier,"Jul 1, 2006",
1,Easy To See Why It's a Box Office Bomb,"This almost feels like a rip-off but because of a few scenes, you barely get your money's worth. What you don't get is your mind blown, which, admit it, is what you really hoped for. We have now seen the future of movies, and what do you know: It already looks old. If I were the WB, I'd audit Singer's books and see where all those hundreds of millions went. Singer had to have funneled large amounts to Switzerland because there's no way this dull clunker has 250 million plus up on the screen. Very below average movie.Superman is a pale echo of his former self, exchanging dialogue with his lady love, Lois (Kate Bosworth), that wouldn't cut it in a bad Harlequin romance. This movie is drunk on itself and the possibilities of cinema to present allegory in grandiloquent gestures and crushing self-importance. Word of mouth will hurt it because, quite frankly, it wasn't very good.",14,19,hardruffrider,"Jul 1, 2006",
5,He's not flying quite as high...,"Superman Returns... after 19 years, 5 directors, and 30 other superhero movies. But the question is, ""Can he still fly?"" -EW MagazineMy personal answer to this question is he can still fly, but not quite as high. Brandon Routh (making his big movie debut) stars as the new Man of Steel in this 19-years-late sequel, with Kate Bosworth (Remember the Titans, Blue Crush, Bee Season) as the tough reporter Lois Lane, and Kevin Spacey (Pay it Forward) as the evil-but-not-quite-evil-enough villain Lex Luthor. In this sequel that doesn't really count as a sequel, Superman returns to planet earth after discovering that his home planet of Krypton was nothing but a graveyard, completely obliterated. After his five-year absence, though, he finds that *gasp* maybe the world doesn't need a hero after all. He returns to his work place as Clark Kent, only to find that the woman who had loved him (as Superman anyway), Lois Lane, is with a man named Richard, and they share a son, whose name is Jason. She has also won the Pulitzer Prize for an article in the newspaper entitled ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"". Ouch. Behind the scenes though, long-time arch-villain Lux Luthor has been awaiting the arrival of Superman, and planning his downfall; along with the deaths of billions of people all over the world. *in big announcer voice* Will Lois ever love Superman again? Will anyone ever figure out that Clark Kent doesn't even need glasses? Will Lux Luthor succeed in his villainous acts? Blah blah blah. The movie was entirely predictable, and quite frankly, I would like to point out that not every superhero movie needs to become a love story. As nice and twisted as that may be, it's lost the twist and nice has turned to annoying. Although the emotions were perfectly portrayed in this flick, and one twist that'll probably lead to a sequel was added, it didn't quite live up to all the hype. Lux Luthor's ""brilliant"" plan may have been brilliant, but pretty lame at the same time. But all-in-all, I can't completely shut down this movie. Because the effects were pretty sweet, I loved the music, and Brandon Routh as Superman was absolutely super. Lex Luthor did have his moments, and I believe Kevin Spacey was amazing in portraying him. And Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane? Genius. So casting was right on, plot was a bit iffy, and the one major twist... well sadly I saw it coming. As a superhero movie fan, I'll say this movie was okay. Just another superhero movie, with a predicted thousand sequels to come.",0,0,HeyJude014,"Jul 1, 2006",

7,"Good to see you again,Supe!","I've been awaiting this movie for some time and finally got to see it a few days ago. And even though this movie is problematic in a least a few respects,it's still to have the big guy back on the big screen.The story's been pretty much common knowledge by now,but just in case you haven't heard,here goes: Superman(Brandon Roush,who actually resembles a young Gregory Peck as well as he does Chris Reeves,IMHO) has left Earth to search for the remains of his home planet Krypton when he learns that astronomers have found remains of the extinct world. He returns to EArth to find that his adoptive home is still about the same,save a couple of details:his beloved Lois Lane(Kate Bosworth,who is made nearly unrecognizable on purpose) has ""gotten over"" him,had a kid and got engaged. Oh,and also his arch nemesis,master criminal Lex Luthor(Kevin Spacey,shaved and bearing more than a passing resemblance to ""Dr.Evil"" of 2002's Austin Powers in Goldmember)was released from prison,managed to snag an elderly heiress,get her to sign over her vast wealth,then reap the reward when she passes. Bent on finding a way to reach superiority over his bane,Luthor seeks out the Fortress of Solitude and once there finds a key piece--or pieces--of leverage in revenge against the Man of Steel.I say this movie is problematic for a couple of reasons: one,this show is cast too young,namely for Superman/Clark Kent and Lois. While Brandon Routh has the right look,feel and quiet confidence to be the titular hero,he seems quite kid-like for someone who is playing Superman five years AFTER what was supposed to be the events of Superman II(or I),when he was already in his thirties. Bosworth as Lois has been a questionable casting to me from the beginning. Here,they take a swan-like,tanned blonde beauty who is previously known for more teen/college age parts(Blue Crush,Win a Date With Tad Hamilton)and stick her into a role where the woman is generally perceived as a)a brunette and b)an established career woman who's been ""Around the block"". While I will say that Katie Holmes' casting as a DA in last summer's Batman Begins was probably a more noticeable misstep,this one is close. Secondly,the tone(and I hate to sound like I'm echoing Roger Ebert here,but...)and visuals of this movie seem to be sucked dry of comic book life,replaced by menacing,dark imagery meant to inspire awe. I will say,however,to those reviews that complained of this movie lacking ""fun"",to this I say:what did you expect? Director Bryan Singer has made a career out of dark,haunting imagery,and I was also somewhat uncertain when I first heard that he was charged with this project. I suspect that maybe he was chosen to helm this project,not only because of his success with the X-Men series,but also because after the campy misfires of the previous Superman films,the producers and WArner Brothers wanted to bring the franchise back with something that seemed to have more gravity. On that they may've succeeded a little TOO well. Thirdly,there are some plausibility gaps here:what happened to Lex's dense henchman Otis? Wouldn't a continent comprised of Kryptonite matter be ENTIRELY poisonous to KAl-El? Exactly what is the purpose for Kitty Kowalski(PArker Posey,vamping it up)in this film,aside form being a distractive element for and against Lex? Why did Clark need glasses back in Smallville? There are others,but I'll care not to divulge them so as to not get windy or give away any spoilers but you get the picture. Michael Dougherty and DAn Harris' screenplay seemed less concerned with keeping strict continuity with the previous cannon and more interested in creating personal drama,mixed with the usual things you expect from a superhero movie.The positives? Keeping John Williams' original score!!! I cannot stress enough how important music is for film,and the sweeping,powerful score from the original movies,to me,is what made the Superman movies,particularly the first two,have such lift to them.The visual imagery,while darker than I'd expect or really want out of a Superman movie,is still effective and even hypnotic. The acting is workable if perhaps perfunctory(James Marsden as Lois' fiancé,Frank Langella as Perry White,Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen,Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent and Tristan Lake-LeBeau as Jason White seem to be asked to do the bare minimum in filling out their places),the screenplay is sufficient. Sound and visual effects are awesome,making you the viewer as bound to the suspense as the characters!IN sum,hardly the perfect superhero movie experience(I'll grudgingly admit that the Spiderman movies STILL rule that),but being a fan of the man with the S on his chest,I'm happy to see him back,and this offering does his story the right,even if it does sacrifice some of the customary campy fun.",11,10,KUAlum26,"Jul 1, 2006",
8,Mr Singer does it again (with help as always)...,"Great Caesar's Ghost indeed! Mightily impressed even! Just sat though Superman Returns and all I can say is I enjoyed myself immensely. Fits into the Superman mythos without straining too much of whats already happened. Timeline wise it seems to be after Superman 2 and ignores the other Superman movies. It starts with Superman/Clark returning to Earth after being away for 5 years without explanation and really doesn't stop until the last of the credits roll. Great characterizations by all. Brandon Routh is great as Superman and nearly perfect as Clark, Kate Bosworth hits almost every note she needs to perfectly; I'm nearly certain now that she is destined for an Oscar when she gets a role that really showcases her talents given the amount of gravity she brings to this. All the supporting parts are great and Kevin Spacey manages to make Lex Luthor much less of a cartoon than Gene Hackman was in the older series which is a credit to the writing and the performances.

10,A truly SUPER movie!!!! Here's why...,"From the opening credits and music, this movie will take you back to the original 1978 Superman movie. Watching this movie instilled in me the same feelings of excitement that I had when I watched the original as a teenager. References from the Superman and Superman II movies are prevalent throughout the story. But this is NOT A REMAKE. The original characters and their various flaws are there, but the story is completely different. Superman has been away for about 5 years visiting the remains of Krypton but is now back to protect the world. Lois Lane has an illegitimate son and a boyfriend and still smokes. Perry White is his usual abrasive self and boyish Jimmy Olsen is along for the ride. Brandon Routh is outstanding as Superman and reminded me of the late Christopher Reeve who will always be Superman to me. Kevin Spacey's portrayal of the villainous Lex Luthor is every bit as good as Gene Hackman's. Even the most casual of Superman fans will love this movie. I never even bothered to look at my watch during this long (2+ hours) movie. I was so caught up in the action, I hardly believed it was that long.

I remember Superman saying ""Truth Justice, and The American Way"". However, in this movie they leave out the ""American Way"". Now it is ""all that stuff"". Yes I figured that one out myself before I read any review. I don't read any reviews before I watch movies because it RUINS them.

6,"It's a bird; it's a plane; it's... well, it's merely OK!","I had high expectations with seeing my childhood favorite superhero back in action on the big screen after such a long wait... I was a bit disappointed with his return! I liked the casting of Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel and he played him well with changing the personality of Clark to a bumbling ho-hum country boy to a well spoken, perfectly stalwart Superman at a moments notice... he did an excellent job. They also had Clark walking around with brown eyes and Superman with blue eyes... nice touch! The problem lies with the new love triangle with Richard, Lois and Superman... Clark is completely left out! The tryst and edge has always been that the triangle was with Superman, Lois and Clark with the inside joke being that Superman and Clark were the same animal!! I didn't care for new new angle at all! I think Bryan Singer needed more action sequences where Superman did super things, but he chose to deal more with this love tryst than show that the man of steel could still kick butt! When he did have Superman being, well, Superman, the film worked and worked well! When he got away from that it kinda stalled! If you're a Superman fan and always liked seeing the big guy in blue tights fly, then go and see the movie... if you are a fair weather fan and you don't know if you will like this one then wait until it's on DVD... you'll be glad that you did!

4,Superman Returns Less Than Super,"Superman Returns Superman Returns highlights just that: After an absence of about five years, Superman (Brandon Routh) is back. Unknown to most of the citizens of earth, when astronomers discover what they believe to be the remnants of Krypton, Superman is unable to resist taking a trip to check it out for himself.When he finally returns, his mother, Martha (Eva Marie Saint) is happy to see him. His old boss, Perry White (Frank Langella) gives his alter ego, Clark Kent, his job back. Photographer Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is glad to see Clark, too. But the woman Superman/Clark loves, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), has moved on.Lois has a son and a fiancé (Perry's nephew, Richard White, played by James Marsden). She's also about to have a Pulitzer Prize for an editorial she wrote entitled ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" Try as she might, though, the return of Superman has also brought the return of at least some of her feelings for him.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has only had his own feelings toward Superman intensify over the past several years. And now he's got a plan to take Superman out for good and become rich and powerful beyond his wildest dreams. The fact that he'll have to kill millions — or even billions — of people to do so is just a minor detail to Lex. Along with his bimbo girlfriend, Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), Lex puts his plans into action even as Superman is doing his best to repair other much more personal things as best he can.There comes a time, though, when choices are made, losses are endured, and even Superman needs all the strength he can muster. While the world watches and waits, the very survival of relationships, humanity, and Superman himself hangs in the balance.Brandon Routh is eerily like the late Christopher Reeve. While we might expect Superman to look like, well, Superman (the ""look"" is well established), Routh looks so much like Reeve, sounds so much like him, and even acts a good deal like him that it's uncanny. The fact that he fills out a spandex suit very nicely doesn't hurt, either. Routh, while probably not the world's greatest actor (at least not yet — you'll recall Reeve himself grew well beyond his Superman role as time went on), is just fine in his portrayal of the relatively one-dimensional Superman.Kevin Spacey seems to be having a good time as Lex Luthor, and imbues the character with a hint of real insanity that we've not seen so clearly before; Parker Posey holds her own with the formidable Spacey — which is saying something. Other supporting cast members are fine, and an extra tip of the hat must go to the late Marlon Brando who appears briefly as Superman's father Jor-El thanks to archive footage of his earlier appearances.The one truly problematic performance is that of Kate Bosworth. It's not that she's a bad actress — she isn't. Instead, she's quite plainly woefully miscast. She looks even younger than she is (what, did she start working at the Daily Planet when she was, like, 14?), she doesn't have the forcefulness to play a top notch reporter let alone a Pulitzer Prize winner, and her chemistry with Routh is all but non-existent. It's not Bosworth's fault that she's the weak link here, but she's never-the-less the weak link.The direction is okay for the most part, and I can excuse moments of camp. This is, after all, a comic book! What's not to be excused are the poor edits, the dismally simplistic story, and a very ordinary script. The special effects are largely quite good — particularly those involving a plummeting jumbo jet — but they can't make up for the other shortcomings, and there are many.Superman Returns is okay, I suppose, but it's considerably less than ""super,"" and certainly less than we had the right to expect.POLITICAL NOTES: Say what you will about the homosexual themes of Superman Returns (I frankly didn't see it) or the religious references (those are there, thanks to either lack of imagination or extraordinary hubris on the parts of the writers), there's something much more important offered up at one point in the film: Lex Luthor gleefully mentions an appeal of an earlier conviction that's based on the fact that Superman didn't give him his Miranda rights. Now while some might interpret this to mean that Miranda isn't all that important, especially not when it comes to the worst criminals, I see it differently. To me, this throwaway line says that no matter how altruistic your motivations, and no matter that you're merely working for ""truth, justice, and the American way,"" the rights of even the baddest of bad guys simply must be upheld if the rest of us are to enjoy the privilege of the same. And that's something with which I thoroughly agree.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Superman Returns is rated PG-13 for ""some intense action violence."" While likely not suitable for the smallest children, I think those of about 10 or so and up will be just fine. I'd frankly be more concerned with the influence on them of the fact that Lois has an illegitimate child, and no one seems to care. Superman Returns will be enjoyed by more than a few people simply because Superman is finally back on the big screen. But for those who expect more from their theater-going experience than some high end effects and some pretty actors, well, you might want to save your anticipation — and your ticket money — for some other film that deserves it more.",0,0,LadyLiberty,"Jul 1, 2006",

I loved that it wasn't an action popcorn movie and was more about the loneliness that is Superman's role in his universe.As for the comments of ""How is it that Lois doesn't remember sleeping with Superman?"" and other such supposed continuity errors, the problem is not with the film but with the memory of those making the comments. For they are answered adequately by watching Superman II.There are plenty of non-raving reviews in these comments that go over the good and bad point of the film.

There are a few flaws with continuity and the editing is a little choppy. I loved seeing Eva Marie Saint (North by North West). She is one of my favorite actresses of years gone by and I wish she had gotten more screen time. Perry White should have been a little more gruff, but overall the casting was done pretty well.

6,Superman's back...but do we want him?,"Well, Superman has returned. However, how long will he stay this time around? From my point of view, not very long.One thing I don't think people will like about this movie is Superman's attitude. He's just too...perfect. He's neatly dressed, very polite, and always there to save the day. But does our society really want a goody-goody after seeing the grittiness of Batman? Do we really need a hero who has no real weaknesses after seeing Spider-Man? Do we really want to see a hero that everybody loves after seeing X-Men? The main problem with bringing Superman back is this: does America really want a Boy Scout in tights, or do we want Wolverine? The movie opens with the feeling of a great sequel to Superman and Superman II, but it just goes downhill right after that.Superman/Clark Kent crash lands back on his childhood farm and begins life again as Clark Kent in the busy city of Metropolis. However, this time around, things aren't as he would have liked them to be. Example: Lois Lane is engaged to another man (JamesMarsden. Suprizingly, when you watch him perform, you hardly ever recognize him as Cyclops from X-Men, which proves how good his acting skills are)! Well, that and a space shuttle/airplane is going haywire in the atmosphere. Heck, all in a days work for Superman.Now, the special effects are top notch in this film. They really are...well...super! The acting is also very great. For his first film, Brandon Routh does a fantastic job as the Man of Steel, though don't expect an Oscar-winning performance. Kate Bosworth does a good job as Lois Lane, and when she and Brandon do a flight scene together, I truly feel like I'm watching Lois and Clark. The best actors in this film, in my opinion, are Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. They are both highly energetic, funny, and realistic, which matches their characters perfectly.However, this movie is not a very good super hero movie. The storyline is bland and their is hardly any super hero-ing going on! Superman spends half of the movie saving random people's lives from random catastrophes. Sure, that's super, but when it comes to the ""epic"" fight between Lex and Superman, there's nothing.And the plot is lame. I won't give it away, but...let's just say that, halfway through the movie, all of the supposed ""suprizes"" will be exposed. No surprise ending. No big twist. Nothing. And that makes for a lame super hero movie.It's a good movie to go see if you seriously have nothing else better to do. The acting and special effects are enough to see it, though, but if you're wanting to see an action-packed epic, see X-Men 3 or wait for Pirates of the Caribbean 2.",0,0,LemonyShepard,"Jul 1, 2006",

5,"Flawed casting, often boring, too many liberties with source material","Brandon Routh is great as Superman / Clarke Kent - a worthy successor to Christopher Reeve and a relief from Dean Cain, an out-and-out beefcake who couldn't play geeky Clarke Kent. Kevin Spacey is no match for Gene Hackman, although deserves credit for being more threatening. I always liked Hackman's line of playing Luthor as a real coward. Obviously this could be down to the writing. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is really miscast, very drippy and, whilst I hated Teri Hatcher's portrayal always getting into trouble and being oh-so-feisty, some of that personality wouldn't have gone amiss here. This is a film for grown-up fans of the original, and has very little to offer kids. Whilst the first was cheesy and the effects very dated or overdone (Superman wipe fading into his costume) it wasn't ever too boring once Krypton blew up. This is boring extensively. Certainly for adults who aren't obsessed fans of Superman, and especially for kids. And I watched the original on TV two weeks beforehand. As for the plot, the source material has been unnecessary distorted to accommodate a modern dysfunctional relationship (the main source of boredom), another cute long-haired American kid, and an underlying general disregard of the traditional logic structure of the Superman comics in order to modernise it in certain ways. It was part of the story's appeal that this all-powerful being can't have a normal relationship with a woman, and that us ordinary guys can! Not any more!

9,A good return to the Superman series which opens the door for many more...,"My first thought upon leaving the cinema was ""I liked that, bit slow in places, but good all the same"". Now I've had time to think about it a little more I think the 'bit slow' part was unjustified. There was a lot of story to get in and so there had to moments when Supe's wasn't deflecting bullets, catching signs, saving planes full of journo's etc... Otherwise the whole movie would have been one big special effect.I particularly like the way that it ignores the horrors that were Superman III and IV! Saying that there are a few holes in the story - What was that thing he flew back in from Krypton? Where did it come from? How did he hold his breath for 5 years (in the old cartoons didn't he have to take oxygen with him into space?) How come no body questions the fact that Clark and Supe's both disappear at the same time and come back at the same time? Just how deep can Lois dive while wearing a full ball gown? Towards the end, when Supes is carrying the rather large rock, and Luthor flys by, why didn't he xray vision the helicopter? There are others but I don't want to give things away for anyone who's not seen it, but the most important other continuity error - he appears to have left his yellow belt back in space, why haven't his pants fell down yet? Brandon Routh, Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworh fit their roles very well (especially Spacey - manic, power crazy and dark, just what Luthor should be). Not sure about Frank Langella as Perry White, something missing there. And Marlon Brando - how well has he aged!?! You wouldn't think he was dead, looks exactly like he did in the first film! ;-) My favourite part - the whole plane/shuttle thingy (again not wanting to give too much away). You almost feel like cheering along with the crowd in the stadium :-) Well worth the money to go and watch. And the best bit - the door is wide open for more Superman films (you'll know what I mean when Brutus gets his final music lesson).

10,Superb,"The latest addition to the Bat Man movies was truly excellent, and pulled that Franchise back up the slope of mediocrity. While the Superman movies of the past were by no means mediocre, this new Superman movie is truly a wonderful addition to the Superhero genre.The movie quickly explains what has happened since we last saw Superman, and allows the film to transition easily from the 1980s to the 2000s.The new choices for all the characters are excellent, with Routh making an excellent Superman. As ""Clark Kent"" he reminded the viewer of the late, great Christopher Reeves, and even bore some resemblance to Reeve at times. From geeky news reporter to Superhero, Routh did a great job. He was an excellent choice.I particularly enjoyed Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthour. Again, a fantastic choice of replacement. He really sold that role.With all due respect to the original Superman crew, the images of Superman flying and such like have really capitalized on today's technology, giving a very realistic feel to the film. Superman's body movement in flight, as well as the movement of the cape were clearly well studied and matched the flight patters very well.Within saying anything to give the story-line away, I would like to add that anyone who sees this movie will be truly surprised and delighted with this movie. When that Superman ""theme"" music hits, one is transported back to the 1970s/1980s, if you were around in that era, and it pulls at the heart strings. I am very glad that the kept that. Very glad.Excellent. Brilliant.",2,3,seanocean,"Jul 1, 2006",
,"Truth, Justice, and the American Way - Liberals strike again","If you did not notice the Liberals in Hollywood removed Superman's Motto. They replaced it with Truth, Justice, and ""all that stuff"".After I did a little research I found out that the traitors behind this movie didn't want to offend international crowds by using his motto and holding America and what it stands for in the high place that it belongs.I wont say anymore but I wanted to make sure that this disgusting omission did not pass without mention. They think we are so stupid.I am sure that this will mean nothing to some that read this but to the rest of us it is just one more example of the problems with liberals.",2,2,R_Orbin,"Jul 1, 2006",
6,Long and uninspired,"Bryan Singer also directed X-Men 2 and is the executive producer for House, M.D. Both of those are, I consider, very good. Good scripts (House is great for that - most decent TV shows have a better script than most blockbuster films), good story, good action, good emotion. I'm really not sure what happened here with Superman Returns. Perhaps he was trying to be too close to the original (perhaps he was told to be close to the original).He's got Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, the mad scientist set out to destroy lives for money. From the trailer, I was expecting lots of crazy antics reminiscent of Gene Hackman's role in the first Superman film. There was only one scene where Spacey was given something to work with, and he did that perfectly. Everything else he spoke was pretty much lame. And that sums up the rest of the script: scenes to drive the background story were given lame scripting, so instead of getting even slightly involved in the characters, you're thinking everything spoken is just too short. The plots of the movie require the characters to say more, and to say it well. Instead, you have the script of an action film: about 400 words total when the movie has the potential to be really moving. Lord, even the Incredibles was deeper than this.Anyway, unimaginative, uninspired, and save for about 3 memorable parts (the third being the ending credits playing the Superman Theme full on) and the fact that the lead must've studied Reeve's role because he is spot on with the facial expressions and voice (the female lead is pretty weak with Lois Lane, though 70% of that problem is, again, the script), the movie was a disappointment.Hollywood recycles movies and recycles directors. Give us something fresh in both areas, or at least don't give us both at once.",3,5,lymond01,"Jul 1, 2006",

6,When you enjoy watching the hero being kicked...,"OK, first the disclaimer, I am not a fan of the comic series (I was when I was 10, long looong ago) so I wasn't expecting the best movie ever, but I am disappointed.To enjoy a movie you need consistency, the world you outline must be consistent in every way or -if you are dealing with a demigod- as much as you can at least. When your world isn't consistent your plot falls piece by piece and, I'm afraid to say, that is what happens with this movie.The acting, well, even Spacey was weak. I have to admit that Brandon Routh does an amazing job as Clark Kent, the character of nerdy moron suits him quite well, sadly in that other role he is quite bland. As a technical note, if you want your actor speaking through his eyes, don't use contact lenses! Or at least cast someone with blue eyes if the script requires it.Reading reviews I realized what I liked most of this movie: the beat up in the island. Is crude, quite violent, and has a really dark atmosphere. Sadly for me (and for the benefit of the plot) Superman doesn't die there. Or perhaps he did because I'm not loosing more money on him.",1,1,anon1mat0,"Jul 1, 2006",

4,"Like a big game of ""Remember This?""","This movie was graphically stimulating but it wasn't much else. The storyline is derivative of the 1978 Superman film and ultimately mediocre in its development. Alas, it also adds a bit of deus ex machina just to push the storyline further and develop one character more than it ever needed to be.The performances were good enough but since the characters haven't evolved any since the first installment, its difficult to say it met any expectations and it made me long for the portrayals done by Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher. Clark is still an uber-geek. Superman is still the tall dark stranger. Jimmy Olsen is still a putz. Lois Lane still does the dumbest things to get the story - only now she brings her kid in tow to push her actions to an even higher level of irresponsibility. Luthor is still surrounded by incompetents and people with limited capacity for the unbridled carnage that Luthor's demented mind is capable of producing.Where Singer shines, however, is when the film shows the emotional connection between Superman and the people of Metropolis. These scenes really portray the bond between Superman and the people he helps. Unfortunately, when Singer focuses that emotional connection between Superman and Lois Lane, it makes Superman come across as more of a stalker than a romantic epic.This is a decent start to a potentially interesting new series of movies - hopefully one where we will see less of Luthor and more of the other villains that make up Superman's unique rogue's gallery. Unfortunately, as a stand alone film, Superman Returns is far from Super.",5,6,TheXeroXone,"Jul 1, 2006",
8,Ambiguous Target,"Superman really returns. The movie title really shows what is inside. It really focused on that topic and for that, I give two thumbs up.The story of how Superman got back to earth after 5 years searching for his original planet and how he tried to adapt to new situation with his work and Lois Lane really makes this new Superman more human. Especially in its fight scenes, Superman is no longer the super Superman, but more like a human Superman.But then, it's a little bit ambiguous. For general audience, it's too heavy and too little action while for adult audience, it's too light and too much action. For drama movie it's too much action and for action movie it's too dramatic. For that reason, I doubt many people would like to watch this movie again after watching it the first time. Maybe, unless for gay people. This new Superman has that gay charm that would attract gay people to watch it over and over again.",0,2,harve_p,"Jul 1, 2006",

I was so afraid Superman Returns wouldn't get past the whole idea of the curse, since it took so long to be made.I was not disappointed. The storyline was fresh and exciting, without reaching too far into the HUH? zone. It has left itself open for sequels much better than Batman Begins did.

4,Superman returns to Earth to save the world.,"Superman Returns is not one of the better comic book movies to date. There is a tremendous desire on its part to have deep character development. Showing Superman's inner angst is apparently a time consuming proposition, too much time. There are some good visual effects and one good action sequence involving an airplane but too little, too long. The pace of the movie is slow, even Superman takes to the air slowly, very slowly. It seemed as though Superman is not the man of steel, but the man of feel. In theory, Kryptonite may be able to one day kill Superman but, in practice, his broken heart can definitely kill the pace of a comic book movie. I wanted to like this movie more but it seemed as though, at times, I was watching a super-stalker rather than a super-hero. X-Men III was a better popcorn movie and either of the Spiderman movies did a much better job of juggling romance and adventure. The new Superman may look the part but it doesn't take x-ray vision to see that this movie was let down by a bloated script and an overly long running time.",1,1,walt012345,"Jul 1, 2006",
1,Boring and tedious,"What a disappointment! I was expecting an exciting film similar to the Xmen trilogy, especially with the same director, but it was not to be. This film took itself too seriously...it tried to make him real,or heaven forbid, human, instead of being tongue-in-cheek as all these types of films need to be to succeed. So now the superhero is not really that super because he had (should I say it)intimate relations with Lois that produced a child. Mushy and boring! One of the few saving graces in this film is the delightful Kevin Spacey.What a wonderful villain, although even he could have been much worse.And of course the special effects were amazing and fantastic which only saves the film just a touch. Apart from Spacey, anyone could have played any of the parts of Superman, Lois, Jimmy etc they were all lifeless.

I was afraid the new era of special effects and new screenplays would take away from what classics the Reeve movies are. But I was pleasantly surprised - the movie and Routh as Superman continued the tradition and the memory of Christopher Reeve. The story is good - effects are good - the acting is good - except in the case of Kevin Spacey where the acting is, as always, superb! The 2 1/2 hours of movie never dragged and kept the full theater entertained. Yes, it is a bit on the bubble gum side - but hasn't Superman always portrayed the wholesome, good guy who saves the world while being madly in love with ""the girl""?! Brandon Routh does a good job and is very much the image and the mannerisms of Christopher Reeve. Kate Bosworth is decent as Lois Lane, and Kevin Spacey - is FANTASTIC as Lex Luthor - even better than Gene Hackman! The only problem I had is that when compared to the movies of the 70's - Lois and Superman have gotten younger. It is a fun and entertaining movie and definitely worth the time and money!

5,Very disappointed about the revival of an American Legend - The story,"The overall story is the main problem I have with this film. It's just not there, you pretty much had to be living on these boards the last year to know what was going on. I went in knowing, and not caring, that there wouldn't be a supervillian, that this film was being billed as a character driven film and I liked that. I like it when the characters, not the action, are at the front of the film. You need that sense of adventure and excitement as well, you need that in any fantasy film, but Ill touch upon that in a little bit. But where was the so called character driven/development story. Outside of Clark's conversation with Martha Kent, who was wasted by the way, the film didn't even touch on his loneliness. They didn't show the character grow at all from beginning to end, or having any touching, soul searching scenes. Clark just went back to Metropolis and back to work as Superman like it was nothing. There was no story to it. Oh, and by the way, there is a problem when Jimmy Olsen and Kitty have more lines than Clark Kent, who should be the heart of the movie, at least in this day and age. And also, it's lame how Clark can simply get his job back, show up for one hour, and then Superman Returns as well. Thats a nice crack team of journalists ya got there, chief. Why the film couldn't be more logical in areas like that is beyond me. The Lois Lane with a fiancé and a kid thing was meh. It wasn't awful but it wasn't truly needed either, it makes sense from the 5 year absence standpoint. They really didn't give Lois much to do though. She was just there, pouting over Superman. They didn't really develop her past a "" I hate him, I love him again "" story arc. No really, thats how it came off on screen. She granted forgiveness because he took her flying. Thats how it seemed. Honestly, the kid was fine. I didn't mind it within the context of the story. But the execution of the storyline was lame and unfulfilling. Where was the drama? I didn't see or feel any. There is more drama in an episode of L&C or Smallville. And as a friend of mine said, Superman and Lois Lane are a piece of American legend and they don't even share a kiss. Now on to Lex Luthor, my biggest pre-viewing problem with the film. Was Lex as comical in this film as in 78? No. I was wrong on that part. But he still wasn't exactly menacing outside of the NK beatdown, which I loved. Did Lex still make dumb, jokey comments. Yes. But it wasn't as bad as I thought. Luthor's big plot however was plain awful. I can't describe it in any other way. It's like Singer and his creative team sat down for a half hour and watched the Luthor scenes in Donner's film, and then came up with the New Krypton idea because of Luthors want for land. This was without a doubt the lamest part of a lame movie. NK was one of the most uncreative things I've ever seen in a comic book film, almost as lame as The Hulk's grand villain idea. With all the source material on Luthor, this was the best Singer could come up with? I'm disappointed and damn near disgusted at the lack of imagination. The NK plot alone is proof that corporate Lex was the way to go, at least from a standpoint of the overall threat in the film. A quick blurb about the Daily Planet, I longed for the days of Lane Smith and Justin Whalin, the Daily Planet crew didn't get an ounce of true character in the film. Yea Jimmy had more lines than Clark, which is screwed up might I once again add, but the character didn't really shine. Where was the talk of Jimmy worrying about his job, I didn't see it, it might have been implied, but not that well. OK, and now that we have addressed how the character driven drama failed, lets go to the fantasy element. Yes folks, Superman is a fantasy film. Good fantasy films require a true sense of awesome adventure and excitement. Superman Returns had none. There was no sense of thrilling excitement about this film, it was to busy getting wrapped in a drama that failed miserably. This film was not fun at all, and don't point to the lame humor throughout. The story wasn't designed to be a thrill ride, I knew that, but for god sakes. It doesn't help that the characters were forgettable and they didn't have that "" don't leave "" feel to them, but when that fails, blow some sh^t up. The cast had no chemistry, and thats key to an adventure film because like Star Wars, the originals mind you, the audience needs to feel the bond between characters. There was zip in terms of bonding. Btw, that is what POTC brings to the table that Superman doesn't, fun and excitement. It might be a different story if Superman Returns had a good story behind it, but it doesn't.",0,0,aaron_phillips28,"Jul 1, 2006",

10,Superman Returns is why I go to the movies,"I am a huge Comic book fan. Superman Returns is a movie that reminds me why. It is everything a Superhero movie should be. I was very excited but also apprehensive abut going to see this movie. My biggest fear was that this movie would be all action and corny one liners like so many Superhero films that are put out today. Superman is so much more than that, it is a love story, an inspirational movie, you should feel something when you watch it needed to be more than just eye-candy. I know it would have action but would it have Heart was my big question. And my conclusion after seeing the movie is that Bryan SInger delivered and from here on out should do all superhero movies.While watching the movie I was transported back to being a little kid watching the first two superman movies. I felt like a Little kid again and that is rear today given all the movies I see that all it seems to inspire me anymore are really emotionally draining and sad scenes like those in Saving Privat Ryan. Action and fun movies just don't feel fun anymore thats why Superman was so special for me I had fun. I sat there and wanted to put my superman PJ's on when I was a kid and fly around the theater. Brandon Routh is the reincarnation of Christopher Reeve. HE was fantastic as both superman and Clark Kent. Kevin Spacey WAs great as Lex Luthor he was evil but not scary unlike so many superhero villains. To many times the villains are over the top scary but Lex Luthor is a man that's what makes him so evil. He doesn't have powers he has his mind and desire and thats it. Kevin Spacey knows this and performs him exactly that way. Itruly love this movie action, heart, emotion, and if you want to be a kid again and forget about the world around you and be five years old again for about 2 and 1/2 hours get yourself one of those oversize bags of popcorn a large soda and go see Superman and if you are a Parent take your kids and show them why movies are made and how a good movie makes you feel.",1,3,Mccarlines,"Jul 2, 2006",
5,"30 minutes of the best Cinema I've ever seen, too bad the movie was over 2 hours long.","Why does the plot take so long to develop?! It's a weak and silly plot that takes forever to come together! On the bright side, Brandon Routh does a nice job, he was so much like Christopher Reeves it was eerie. Parker Posey is very good as usual really stole the show in many respects. The rest of the cast's performances ranged from adequate to bland. I felt nothing for or from Lois at all, and the romance between her and superman fizzled at best. There is just no chemistry between the two. Margot Kidder really had that part tight.Honestly though, a good 45 minutes could be cut from the film and a little more superman action added. There were some spots that really just drug on and on. My 13 year old daughter and my 15 year old son both thought it was mostly boring.Bryan Singer would have done us a big favor if he would have fixed the mess they called X-Men 3 and waited for a better script to bring back Superman. As it is we got a lousy X-Men and a so-so Superman when just a little more effort, possibly in the editing, we could have enjoyed two really good films.It is important to remember that this is not the superman we all knew and loved. The Superman that only drank milk, and married Lois before he fathered a child is officially dead. I suspect that his truth justice and American way ethics are in the Hollywood coma ward with little hope of revival as well. This Superman is sort of morally not so super as he used to be. Just so you parents hoping for a role model for the kiddies don't get your hopes up too much.For some reason Hollywood seems hell bent on kicking Christ and Christians around when ever they get the chance. This film is no exception. Superman who is portrayed as a peeping tom that attempts to split a basically, happy family up, is taken through a mock passion episode. He subtly reenacts the points of the cross, is pierced through his side, is baptized nearly to his death and ascends to heaven. After he is rejuvenated by the Sun, he returns to carry an unbelievably huge chunk of earth, representing the sins of the world I guess and caste it into space. Several statements referring to Superman as the Savior of the world are made to help you connect the dots. No one would consider portraying Superman as a modern representation of Buda, or Allah or even Mohammed. The rest of us are fair game though so that only leaves Jesus. However, on Superman's best day he is no Jesus Christ. The whole comparison was childish and because Superman has no moral or emotional triumph to propel him to this messianic height the savior thing falls flat. As a result an already weak plot struggles along even more strained.I'm not sure why these people can't just make a fun summer movie without trying to make some silly social commentary. For all their efforts it's just another lousy film that could have been great if a few people's egos and agendas could have been put aside to make a quality movie. Too bad, but the results are clear in the box office returns.",1,1,guitarcarl,"Jul 2, 2006",

Where were the cute one liners for Superman and Lex. There was no humor from the old series. I won't see this movie again. Better luck on a sequel. The feeling I got about the whole movie was that they took an hour and forty five minute movie and pushed in an extra hour of just action. There should be a lot more development of the characters. I know that it is supposed to follow that you have seen the previous movies and know the back story of each.

It was refreshing that we forgot the following adventures of III and IV...

She was not very much on scale, however, since she might be back, hopefully we can model the character to be more on the adventurous side...But, put Kevin Spacey anytime on the villain side and you got a great result. His portrayal of Lex Luthor made me forget Gene Hackman's first interpretation and of course, Luthor didn't have hair at this time ! Only other thing: film is a bit too long and should have been at a respectable limit of two hours. There were too much sequences that should have been taken off...But, hey, the movie's good anyway.

There's other major inconsistencies, like Superman landing on an island of kryptonite and not even noticing it, then getting beaten up because all his powers are gone... yet then he can pick the whole island up with limited difficulty? That makes no sense.And I know the whole Clark Kent disguise thing is a bit of a wink-and-nudge joke anyway, but really...

Also, because Bryan Singer was directing and his X-MEN movies are so good (haven't seen the 3rd one yet.) Physically, Brandon Routh has it all. I think he used the opportunities the story gave him well, but there was not much for him to do. He had very few lines and even the montages of him saving several people in a row were very short. The movie is called SUPERMAN, so let's be able to see him.Kate Bosworth was a terrible, terrible choice for Lois Lane. Lois Lane is not supposed to be conventionally beautiful--which Kate is--and she is supposed to be more plucky and self-reliant--which Kate's Lois wasn't. Physically, she was ALL WRONG. Personality-wise, all wrong. Someone like Marla Sokoloff would've been good--someone edgy and a little sarcastic.The same goes for casting Frank Langella as Perry White. Whose idea was that? He's too tall, too exotic, too expressionless. Bad, bad, choice. I thought the bartender looked more like our idea of Perry White. The bartender--who was the 50's Superman show's Jimmy Olsen.Kevin Spacey did a good job as Lex Luthor, although I think Lex Luthor would be disappointed with the thin plot line he was given. Hello? Creating your own spiky little country? One that, as Ebert said, a billy goat wouldn't live on. Give me a break.After the movie I came home and watched Christopher Reeve's SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II. They are SOOoooo much better. The technology was lesser because of the time period, but it didn't matter because there was a great story, cast, and superior acting.The new movie's pacing was very off, spending too much time on unimportant action (i.e. Lois on the plane, Lois on the sea plane, Lois on the yacht.) I think we saw more Lois than Superman--and she wasn't that good. I also think they could've given Lois's kid A LOT more to do than just bumping into doors with a trashcan on his head and staring at everything through those shaggy bangs of his. Would someone please give that poor child a haircut? When I saw the photo on Lois's desk, I thought he was a girl at first.And poor James Marsden getting roped into playing the good-looking neglected fiancée. Sorry, Cyclops, that was a misfire.This is a movie worth missing, I'm afraid. 2 1/2 hours of Lois Lane with an occasional Superman is not the way to return the iconic character to the public. I think my favorite character was actually Parker Posey's Kitty and her cannibalistic dog. What does that say about the movie?",0,0,laughing_cat,"Jul 2, 2006",

All told we've gotten a movie that is faithful to the vision of Richard Donner. Brandon Routh's deliberate similarities to Christopher Reeves are incredible and make it even better. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is superb.I was completely pulled into the story, from the moment it opened with John Williams easily-recognized score and the credit style reminiscent of Superman and Superman II. The brief revisit to Smallville and Ma Kent played well to the Superman mythos as well as providing a good spring to the rest of the story.The rest balanced well between Lex Luthor's newest scheme for land while getting his revenge against Superman and the focus on the Superman/Lois Lane relationship.

I loved it! Admittedly I'm a huge huge huge Superman fan since I was a kid, but I enjoyed this just as much as the original with Christofer Reeve. I realize that some people may want to lynch me for this, but to a point I thought Brandon did a better job.Kevin Spacey was perfect for Lex Luthor.The story was pretty typical for a Superman type story, especially if you read the comic books of old.I've heard a lot of people talking about a Christ/Superman thing going on. I am a serious Evangelical Christian and the only thing that kinda twinged me was the ""savior"" conversation with him and Lois. Other than that I've heard people trying to connect some of his stances while flying or falling or whatever with the Cross. I'm here to say as both a Superman fan and Jesus freak that those stances are typical in the comic strip, and are not unusual to be seen. I have serious doubts about intentional correlation.

,Superman Returns To The Screen With Dignity Intact,"Lois Lane,the love of the Man Of Steel's life has written him off,has put him behind her and even won a Pulitzer Prize column for an article on why the world no longer needs Superman. By clearly,Lois Lane was wrong,dead wrong. The world needs Superman so much that Hollywood spent almost a decade on false starts to revive the franchise with some of the top directors in Hollywood to helm the project to bring the kid from the planet Krypton back to the big screen. The mysterious and fictional saga of Superman's departure has fill a void during the last decade. The last time Superman's adventures continued was on television with ""Smallville"",and ""Lois and Clark:The New Adventures of Superman"" not to mention various animated television series that featured the Man of Steel in different formats. However,Superman has become a forgotten man not only at the movies but in Hollywood as well where other comic book heroes had come to reign.In the 19 years since Christopher Reeve's fourth and final appearance as the hero in ""Superman IV:The Quest For Peace"",Hollywood has churned out five Batman flicks with four different actors in the title role. While Marvel Comics continue to dominate and flourish at the box office, DC Comics was struggling to stay a float of the box office reign of superheroes. While ""Spider-Man"" and ""The X-Men"" became the Cadillac of superhero franchises,DC Comics characters like ""Batman"" and others were catching hell. The last DC Comics character,last year's ""Batman Begins"" became the thrill ride of the summer thus saving the DC Comics from oblivion. Until now,Superman hasn't been since in over 19 years at the box office. The longer Superman with his good mannerisms and Boy Scout values languished in development at Warner Bors.,the more it looked as of his time has passed in favor of the darker,conflicted heroes that came from the pages of Marvel Comics(""Spider-Man"",""X-Men"")and DC Comics(""Batman"").All of that has change when director Bryan Singer,who directed the first two ""X-Men"" movies and passed on the third installment of the series to bring back an American icon out of retirement to save the planet once again from certain doom. ""Superman Returns"" is a grand achievement of this and what Singer has done was bring back a hero and brought him back with dignity intact and much more. This is a dazzling spectacle of technological proportions and director Bryan Singer was a ideal choice to bring back the beloved franchise. Singer gave it his own vision and retain key elements from the original 1978 ""Superman"" film including John Williams' Oscar-winning rousting score from the original movie not to mention archive footage of Marlon Brando as Superman's father Jor-El.Newcomer Brandon Routh takes over the role that was once played by Christopher Reeve and he does wonders with the part. Superman returns to Earth after a long mission to the lost remains of his home planet,Krypton,only to find the love of his life Lois Lane(Kate Bosworth)has gotten on fine without him. She has a son,and is engaged to her fiancé(James Marsden of ""X-Men"" fame)and has matured and moved on with her life. When Superman's arch-enemy Lex Luthor(Kevin Spacey)is released from prison to begin his diabolical plan for domination of the world it is up to Superman to return to Earth and save the planet from Luthor's total destruction,and to get back with the love of his life in the process. As the villain Lex Luthor,I got to say that was no better actor to revive the part better than Kevin Spacey and to me this his best work yet. He knows how to command an audience and it shows. Several scenes were excellent including the plane sequence which is jaw-dropping to behold. This is me was the long-awaited hype of the summer that has finally came and ""Superman Returns"" delivers. It's everything you wanted in a movie,non-stop thrills and unbelievable action at every turn. Truly,the one movie that is waiting in line at the theatres to see.",0,2,raysond,"Jul 2, 2006",

9,My brief thoughts on Superman Returns,"A few Days ago I saw Superman Returns in the IMAX 3D. Just hearing the ""John Williams"" Superman Theme and seeing the beginning credits, brought tears to my eyes, at that point I knew I will be in for a ride. Brandon Routh does a very good job of portraying Superman, and Kate Bosworth portrayed Lois Lane very well, yet Lois Lane wasn't as high strong as I thought she would be in this film, but 5 years and a child could change a person. It doesn't really matter if Brandon Routh resembles the way Christopher Reeve portrayed Superman/Clark but he did a good job of it. Brandon Routh was a good choice for Superman. I also find this film had more of an emotional impact on the audience, which means the director, Bryan Singer, did an excellent job of telling the story on screen. There was just the right amount of action and story telling. The plot had met my expectations and it had it's surprises and twists. Kevin Spacey was a very convincing Lex Luthor and Parker Posey playing Kitty Kowalski was more of the comic relief in this film, showing the odd yet funny chemistry between Kitty and Lex. The rest of the cast also did a good job of portraying their characters. I give Bryan Singer 2 thumbs up for this film, it is not easy these days coming out with a film of this genre and the fact that it is a returning concept. Bryan Singer has created a great visual spectacle that I know everyone will enjoy, even if you are not a Superman Fan. Great job cast and crew on bringing Superman back to the big screen.",0,2,Ramis-Samis,"Jul 2, 2006",
8,"Overall, pretty good","This movie was pretty good. Of coarse it had its cliché' moments, but you get that with any comic book movie. Having personally never seen any of the previous Superman movies, I found this one easy to follow. It was a bit long, but it all had to do with the plot, un-like King Kong, which was extremely dragged out. I'm glad the citizens of ""I forget which city Superman protects"" don't hate Superman for saving people, unlike Spiderman, where everyone pushes him around and they want to arrest him. Bryan Singer did an overall good job in this movie. If you like X-Men 1 and 2, most likely you'll like Superman Returns, so check it out...",0,2,Skinny-Cartman,"Jul 2, 2006",
,man of steel is back!,"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Superman FILM REVIEW: SUPERMAN RETURNSCast: Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey Running time 154 minutes In what has been toted as the most anticipated DC Comics Superhero film of the decade, Superman Returns finally hit the big screens across South Africa! The Man of Steel is back in all his glory, to save the world from the iniquitous elements intent on its destruction.The caped-crusader and champion of justice, equality and the American way is back to save the world yet again. He has been in self-imposed exile for five years, seeking the truth about the whether or not his planet Krypton was destroyed. During his absence the world was beginning to lose faith in their hero, but now he has returned to guide humanity down an honourable path and to defend the inalienable rights of mankind.The film lends a dreamy air to the Superman theme. Most of the spotlight is directed at the ambiance and spectacular panoramas of the iconic figure's escapades, rather than actually focusing on his crime-fighting exploits. Make no error, Superman has his fair share of outrageous stunts to perform, but one feels that there are limited scenes where his awesome ability is shown. Having said that though, his strength, speed and dexterity are already well known to fans the world over.This film goes to great pains to focus on the emotional connection between Superman and Lois Lane. After his mysterious disappearance for five years, Lois moved on with her life and gave birth to a delightful little boy. Questions abound as to who his real father is, but that much is left to the final scenes of this enchanting tale.Lex Luthor is portrayed by the ever-versatile Kevin Spacey, who starts out with great potential to convince audiences of Luthor's vile conduct. The antipathy between Luthor and Superman is not sufficiently explored and it is perhaps at this very juncture that the director missed a trick or two. Lex becomes a rather static character, as do most of the characters in the film. Ultimately this film isn't a depiction of great cinematic acting ability or even spectacular special effects, but it succeeds in rehashing what was such an indelible and prominent component of many people's lives from yesteryear!",0,0,brettchatz-1,"Jul 2, 2006",
3,Maybe its just me but...,"Did anyone else find it odd that supposedly the story takes place 5 years later after the prequels. Lois Lane moved on with her career and life. Casting Kate Bosworth was a mistake, cause for this to be true she must have been in high school when she first met Superman, by the looks of her. I know they tried to make her look a bit older but come on. She was completely miscast in my opinion, an actress closer to thirty would have been more believable. I even suggested to a friend of mine, that Superman and Lois should have been cast in their mid 30's. A great Lois Lane would have been Sandra Bullock, and Bryan Singer could have still had his 30 something no name Superman. Kevin Spacy was excellent but outside of that the story was drawn out and unsatisfying. It will still make a bundle though.",2,3,mike-3200,"Jul 2, 2006",

I can only figure that some people who are so hard on this movie either A) Don't like Superman and turn this into a DC/Marvel thing (which I never understood, since I never considered myself either a DC or Marvel fan, but a COMIC fan), or B), the film did not fit how they wanted the sequel to be, such as, for example, they either wanted the self assured, competent Clark Kent as portrayed as Lois and Clark or Smallville. Personally, I am perfectly fine with the classic bumbling portrayal of Clark as portrayed in this movie.The only thing the film lacked was a knockout, spectacular final. I would have bumped it up to a 9 if it would have had that.This promising feature makes me wait with great anticipation for the sequel!",0,2,gallagher-8,"Jul 2, 2006",

7,Decent but wouldn't care much for sequels,"The movie is not bad. Despite it's 2 hours 40 mins long, there's seldom a moment you'd find yourself checking your watch. But unless any sequels promise something very dramatic (e.g., some really interesting development of the twist revealed in this movie), as far as I am concerned this movie could well be the last of the Superman franchise.In terms of action, it's fine. But there's nothing new and breath-taking. Swinging up and down (like Spiderman) and showcasing cool gadgets (like Batman) can be fun. But flying and lifting (what Superman does most often) cannot be said to be spectacular from audience's point of view, I am afraid.In terms of romance, I am glad that the story has Lois Lane engaged to someone else. That at least presents a cross-road and makes things a little more interesting. But I think it's a missed opportunity. Nothing in the movie suggests to me that Lois Lane's love for her fiancé is anywhere close to what she has for Superman.Most of the joy of watching the movie comes from the villains. Most scenes with Lex Luthor and his sidekicks in them are fun. Unfortunately, overall, there's little in the movie to merit anything more than a ""decent"" rating.",0,2,thomasaaa123,"Jul 2, 2006",
1,"Not just bad, but a betrayal against all true fans","I gave the screen the finger on my way out of the screening on opening night. That's how much I hated this movie.Brandon Routh does not have Superman in him. He's OK (and just OK) as Clark Kent, but every time we wee him as Superman, he looks nervous and tense, like he's wondering who's buying this. Kate Bosworth is just plain too young to play Lois Lane. She was 23 when this movie was made, and her Lois Lane looks like a teenager. I was really looking forward to Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, but he was no fun at all. James Marsden and Parker Posey play two completely disposable and unnecessary characters which is interesting because had they cast Marsden as Superman and Posey as Lois Lane, you'd have the makings of a fine Superman movie.The movie is poorly thought out, dark, ugly, and no fun at all. It's not appropriate for kids, the tone is all wrong, and there is no action whatsoever in the whole last half-hour. No action at all in the last half-hour of a summer superhero movie. Superman is supposed to be high adventure, not high melodrama. This is not Superman for a new generation, this is Superman for the Usual Suspects audience. This is Superman done dark and dirty.We were sold on this movie being another go at a Superman III, but the plots are so similar that this can only be a full-on remake of Superman The Movie. My only guess is that the producers sold the studio on this movie as paying homage to the '78 Donner film, and then Singer and company panicked when time started getting tight and just went ahead with whatever they could hash out in an evening. If Donner's '78 Superman was a smooth Frank Sinatra ballad, Superman Returns is a dirty, revved-up cover version performed by a really bad punk band.I spent my early childhood with a red cape permanently attached around my neck, so you can imagine that I was pretty predisposed to liking this movie. But now I feel ripped off. I feel ripped off not for the $13 I spent on my ticket, and not even for the months spent being excited for this movie. I feel ripped off for all of the years spent calling Superman my hero.",9,12,sean-790,"Jul 2, 2006",
10,"Don't be a puppet for people that hate this movie, make your own choice by watching this movie !","I have seen this movie already, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. I know that Superman Returns is not doing well at the box office, it's not Warner Bros. fault, nor Singer's, nor the cast's fault, it's the comments made earlier about Superman being gay. Bryan Singer is an openly gay director. He directed X-Men and X-2, with no controversy whatsoever about his sexuality. Now that he left X-3 to do Superman, some jealous die-hard fan of the X-men franchise wanted Superman to fail, just because Singer left X-Men 3 to pursue another superhero, which happens to be a DC comics superhero, and not a Marvel comics one. Just because he did not do X-Men 3, the person thought that X-3 would flop, and Superman would break box office records. Well, vice versa. X-Men succeeded, and Superman failed. I am shocked to hear that Superman is not doing well at the box office. Now because one person said something negative about Superman, everyone believes that person, over a baseless rumor. If you have read this, and haven't seen Superman Returns, then go over to your local theater near you and watch this movie. Trust me, it's worth it.

3,I do not recommend this movie.,The movie was boring. Superman was nothing like the hero I grew up with. I did not like the injection of the religious symbolism. When I saw the movie the theatre was sold out. The audience was older than usual. There were a lot of kids but many more women in their 6o's and 70's. There was not a single reaction during the movie either from the kids or the older audience. I think everyone was as bored as I was. The cast was great but the dialogue was woefully short of meaningful content. The only part I liked was the saving of the space shuttle. I'm a Star Trek TNG fan and any one hour episode was more exciting that this movie. Thirty minute MASH episodes are much better written.

8,Will he return again?,"I watched Superman Returns in Imax 3D. First, a discussion of the movie, then the Imax.The movie is long, but because of very good special effects, an excellent sound track, and strong visuals, the movie holds the viewer's interest most of the time. There are a couple of anti-climatic endings, but these were probably necessary to tie up loose ends, and to leave some things open for more sequels. There were scenes with enough comic relief to bring laughter from the audience. For the most part, the acting was good to adequate. Frank Langella is one exception. Langella is an excellent actor, and as a vampire excelled. In this movie, however, he was less than adequate as Perry White. He seemed considerate and almost gentle at times--not the gruff, cigar-smoking editor of the Daily Planet. The portrayal of Jimmie Olsen likewise more annoying, and less naive than the comic book version. Now for the major roles: Christopher Reeve was a very good Superman. Brandon Routh is a very good Christopher Reeve, meaning that he played the role well, but his physical appearance uncannily recalled Reeve. I'm not sure if that's detrimental or advantageous, but you definitely recall Christopher Reeve. Kate Bosworth performed well, but seems too young and definitely much better looking than Lois Lane of comic books. Kevin Spacey, one of my favorite actors, as Lex Luthor did not seem menacing enough. In summary, for acting 2 stars out of three.For film production, 3 stars out of three. For story, 2 stars of 3. Extra credit for holding my interest: 1 star. Total=8 stars out of 10.(That breakdown is just to reveal how an 8 rating was derived.)Now for the Imax 3-D. The 3-D sequences (there were only 3 major scenes in 3D) were a major disappointment. The scenes in 3D gave a very good 3D effect, but the scenes included a lot of high-speed action. This tended to give choppy 3D that gave an unpleasant viewing experience. The coming attractions for 3 upcoming animated features were all in 3D, and they had a better overall 3D effect. I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoyed the first Reeve Superman, or the television version years ago. But I would recommend that you save some money and skip the Imax 3D. Of course, I'm entranced by 3D and would see it again. Just realize before you go that some of the best scenes that might lend themselves to 3D will not be in 3D; and some very choppy action scenes are shown in 3D.",0,2,jannagal,"Jul 2, 2006",
5,"Does nothing new with the franchise, but still manages to be decent film.","Superman has always been a big deal, but nowadays, his battles are no more than what they appear to be on the surface, and that's a shame. While many superheroes have their own inner battles and beliefs that conflict with their decisions to make interesting situations, Superman simply fights evil because he knows that's what he's there for, and that's just not fun to watch.I came to see Superman Returns wanting to see something new done with Superman to make him more than just a two-dimensional comic book character, but nothing more is done with this movie than what was done with the Christopher Reeve films. It's predictable, it's unevenly-paced, and none of the characters are really interesting, but this film pays homage to its predecessors in a charming way.It might just be me, but Lex Luthor doesn't seem to be the right villain to pit Superman against in Hollywood, and in spite of an excellent (as always) performance by Kevin Spacey, it's just not fun to watch. Let's face it: Luthor is not a super villain. He's just a exploiting madman looking to gain power. He has no real motivations towards evil, except for greed. He's no competition for the almost God-like strength of Superman.Superman is played by Brandon Routh, who does it justice just as Christopher Reeve did. It's unfortunate that he came after Reeve, because it's apparent that he just tried to copy the style already created by his predecessor. He did well, though, and I guess that's all that matters.The final main character, Lois Lane, was played in the exact same way by Kate Bosworth, who followed Margot Kidder's example perfectly, but was actually too young for the part. I can't hold that against her, though.I guess my main problem with this movie is that they really just rehashed pre-used material. Superman never encounters any solid competition, and hence, this movie becomes pointless. If you're looking for just a simple popcorn flick, this movie is great, but a ""summer blockbuster"" it is not.-DB",0,0,misterkick,"Jul 2, 2006",

He did the Kent role OK, but I couldn't help thinking the director kept saying to himself and to the set, ""OK, cut....do that grin a little bit more, yes, that's it - Now, you look just like Chris Reeves - let's try that again"". The transition from the meek Kent to the strong silent Superman is missing. Period.Lois Lane - first I have to say that Kate B. is a babe - there's no argument about that. And, I thought her acting was good, because even though I wanted to, I never saw that beach babe that she is so familiar to all of us as. Good job with that. But, I miss the quirky Lois Lane, the investigative reporter Lois Lane, the look of awe and wonder as she interacts with Superman Lois Lane. It just didn't work for me, but again she did a good job with the script she had.Lex - the man, the bad boy - Kevin Spacey is a fantastic actor, probably the best in this film by far - but I saw him like this: He was to the Lex Luther played by Gene Hackman what Depp was to Gene Wilder's Wonka, a dilution and distortion of the character. He seemed trying to be more creepy and eccentric than evil. Hackman WAS Lex Luther - Spacey never got past being Spacey in a skull cap.The kid actor - never seen him before, and I'll never knock a cute kid, period. So I'll just say that he needed some direction he didn't get and leave it at that.Overall: The story was slapdash, cut-and-paste - a few, well, more than a few unnecessary scenes, and of those several were really, really unnecessarily long - very long. And, for what ? Nothing from what I saw.And the random save-the-poor citizen scenes - SO much more could have been do with this to entertain the audience. But they all seemed to be just thrown in as a needed feature, but they were boring, and basic, and just, well, dumb looking.See it if you want, you may like it. But it's not in the same league with the original IMHO.",0,0,asm65,"Jul 2, 2006",
10,Superman Returns in the BEST movie ever,i literally just saw this movie. i saw it in IMAX and i don't recommend the IMAX theater. IMAX doesn't change the movie and you only put the glasses on 3 or 4 times. This movie was great though. I loved it and it had GREAT suspension. and you will look at the time- 2hrs and 34 mins(memorized :) ) and think WOW thats too long. nope its not like king Kong which was a waste of 3hrs! great movie and definitely recommend it. for the kids- some blood or not suitable& also moments of abuse like killing someone by kicking and punching and stabbing. but for a 13 year old girl- great movie totally fun and i definitely Recommend IT!!!!!!,0,2,coachgirl4065,"Jul 2, 2006",
8,"Thank you, Bryan Singer.....!","It's been ages since I've seen a movie that brings me back to my childhood, but, the director's obvious love of the material pays homage to the films of the 70's with the updated special effects we enjoy in 21st century film. I am a longtime fan of Superman; he was my favorite comic book hero, but I mention this only in passing; we could have been subjected to modern day cinema clichés, tired dialog and cheesy acting. Brandon Routh impressed me a great deal with his ability to show his inner turmoil and longing for a relationship he may never have. Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane surprised me, as well. She didn't brash us with a mouthy performance....I felt for her longing to distance herself from her absent ""hero"". And Spacey's Lex Luthor was restrained enough not to take it over the top and give us a campy villain. This film touches our longing for a real hero who can save us from our violent real world; we wish for a ""Super"" person to swoop down and make it all better. Thank you, Bryan, cast and crew.....I felt 12 years old again, and full of hope. Escpapist movie-making at it's best!",0,2,reelfreek414,"Jul 2, 2006",
3,yikes!!!,"This movie was quite disappointing. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and the special effects were all quite nice. Superman was quite studly and all the buildings and people sparkled. However, the dialogue can best be described as contrite, forced and superficial. The obvious quickly tossed aside comparison between Clark Kent and Superman was there. I vividly remember a cringe-inducing one-liner by Mrs. Lois Lane that was so god-awful that I'm sure the theater beside us could have heard our chorus of groans. I think i threw up a little, but that could have been caused by the many other problems. Usually, a movie engrosses me during the experience and I almost always thoroughly enjoy myself without noticing faults. However, during the lulls when ""actor"" Brandon Routh started talking, i began thinking about the story. I won't give it away but let's just say that you've most likely seen it before. Countless times. I also began to look past the pretty pictures to what the filmmakers actually shot. The mood was quite undefined. This movie really didn't ever know what it wanted to be. The filmmakers tried for the darkness of the recent Batman Begins but never escaped the happy go lucky charm of Metropolis that Gotham never had. My final complaint is one thing that definitely could have saved this movie. Every character was 10 kinds of boring. Lois Lane wore drab suits and showed no emotion; I can't even picture Kate Bosworth's face the day afterward! Brandon Routh was handsome in a very boring way. He seemed like a complete doofus reading every line off of cue cards. All of his lines were delivered with an incredibly annoying and obviously feigned confidence. Great actors don't act, they do and they are. Brandon Routh has good looks and talent but he's still acting. He isn't Superman, although he tries to convince the audience as well as himself throughout the entire movie. Clark Kent was totally forgotten as a player as well. Superman is a great and deep character. Unfortunately, This movie forgot that. It lacks depth, it lacks the reality that other superhero movies have had, it lacks story, it lacks dialogue and it lacks originality. There are better superhero movies out there. Try watching the original superman or the great TV series, Smallville (it's not just for 12-year old girls). If you do watch this movie, do so for your own nostalgic purposes or for the pretty pictures. The thrills are lacking as well as the enjoyment. Maybe next time, folks.Tyler Wilson",0,0,rusell2120,"Jul 2, 2006",

1,The Man of steel is made of cotton,"I went into this picture believing I would see an interesting and thought provoking film about large and massive men. Instead is was flourished with a feckless and lame picture about the interactions between stupid American pigs. Firstly the main character is a reporter for a paper (i forgot the name). He is not a very convincing reporter, as well as a convincing superman. He is one of the worst actors and quite a disgrace to thespians abroad.This film also features a female attraction. I forgot her name, she was quite a terrible and ugly woman.Getting back to the superman. I was quite unintimidated by the acting of Kevin spacey. He looked like an unforceful and silly actor. He tries to be antagonistic but bitterly fails.Now I shall return to Superman. Superman looked a like a man.",3,5,angry127,"Jul 2, 2006",
10,Brandon Routh is Superman.  Be very thankful.,"Imagine you're an actor in his mid-20s and you sign on to play one of the most iconic roles in the history of popular culture, and no matter how good you are, there will always be those who will trash your performance. Everyone has ideas about their image and personality for Superman, and they tend to personalize them. I, for one, am glad to see that most critics and reviewers have accepted Brandon Routh as Superman, because he deserves every bit of praise he is receiving.Brandon Routh was picked because of his looks and build, everyone knows that. Nevertheless, he gives an earnest performance as Clark Kent with his mannerisms and is awkward and inherently likable without being clumsy. He is better as Superman, not just physically, but also in the stoic and serious presence he gives the character. He delivers the actions sequences with impressive physicality and stamina, but he is also quite believable when Superman shows his vulnerable side. As for his youthful appearance, the director wisely chose someone young enough who can still be believable several years from now in a franchise package.The inevitable and never-ending comparisons to Christopher Reeve are unfair and misguided. Reeve was awesome in the first two Superman films, but he was merely cashing a big paycheck for the last two dreadful films as he sought other ""serious"" roles, most of which went nowhere (anyone see ""The Bostonians"" lately? I didn't think so.) He didn't even bother to do the necessary sit-ups to make himself believable as Superman in the last installment, and his Clark Kent by that time was an embarrassing parody of its former self.Also, imagine if Nicolas Cage (yes, he was seriously considered at one point) or some other established actor was cast for the role of Superman, or if the role was played for camp or laughs. No one would take it seriously.So relax and enjoy the film and enjoy Routh as Superman. He has lived up to every expectation that has so far been hurled at him and has been largely accepted by the public as the new Man of Steel. And remember, actors do not own roles, they merely play them.",3,3,dc4alund,"Jul 2, 2006",

1,What a disappointment of a movie.,Man what a shame this movie was really Bad.Very few action sequences(they were good).But the most part of the movie was full of sentiment.They had to show the ugly female actress who was playing Lois lane form the starting till the end. The movie was filled with too much Sentiment.No one delivered a worthwhile performance in acting.The movies colors were too dull.They should have used colors like they use for spider-man it could have even been brighter than spider-man.I don't know what the hell they spent money on 200 million$.The guy playing superman is OK he could do a bit more emoting but wait i think he had very little screen time most of it was covered by ugly Louis lane.I should have gone to watch X-men 3 in the theater instead of this after seeing the trailer this looked promising so i went for it saw it in RDX also in theater still man how i regret it.The action scenes u see in the trailer thats the only action u get to see in the movie maybe 2 more boy was it disappointing.Maybe Christopher Reeves died soon so that he could avoid seeing this disappointment of a movie.,2,3,ashwinram27,"Jul 2, 2006",
7,"Superman Returns really gets you into the movie, but at times it might disappoint you with inadequate pacing and under-developed characters.","Honestly, I would have liked the movie more if it had better pacing. The many action scenes within the movie really grab you and immerse you into the action, giving you a sense of panic. However, some of the slower paced scenes were rather a bore, especially the epilogue. They tried adding depths to the story, but in the end felt dragged unnecessarily. Those scenes weren't terrible, but might have been better if they were shortened. The cinematography and special effects were excellent though. Every shot and action was astonishing.The character development between Lois, her family and Superman could be argued as not enough, but I felt it was a good place to leave it hanging. They have the audience experience the emotions that goes through the parties, but not necessarily tell you all of it in details. Lex Luthor and the villains however felt unnecessarily incompetent and weak, when compared to the strong figure of Superman. Lex Luthor was known to be an evil genius, however in the film you see him as an evil incompetence, since he was unable to gather useful people who would actually contribute to his cause actively and positively. To me, Lex Luthor the character did not seem to be a threat, whereas the consequences of his actions seemed more fittingly so. In simpler terms, Lex Luthor seemed more like an underdone, insane villain rather than a morbid evil genius with an insane scheme.Personally, I also disliked the overplayed undertone (more like an overtone really...) of the comparison between Superman and Christ. The overall theme was way to strong which felt like it was forced fed and choked down your throat. Superman is SUPER. We GET IT. It might have been better if it was toned down more when we aren't treated like incompetent thinkers who don't get the metaphor. I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not the metaphor was fitting between the two of them.A closing comment: Superman Return might have been better if they ditched some goofy humours that detracts realism from the movie, and replace with some more intelligence humours to relax audiences from the intense (and impressive) actions.",2,4,Acrobad,"Jul 2, 2006",
9,...so sad.,"It's a tragedy how surprisingly low Supermans opening numbers were. It's a great movie, but even if it wasn't, it's Superman for crying out loud! I don't understand why people are so much more interested in spiderman or that stupid Xmen 3. Spiderman's great and all, but superman is the great comic book hero of all time. And I'm not just stating my opinion, I mean our culture just uses superman as the main reference to heroes. It's a fact. It just surprises me that's all. Especially since I liked the movie and appreciated it's focus on the characters and story and emotional tone, not just soul-less action like Xmen3.

7,Slightly off-target,"Superman Returns has the feel of the Christopher Reeve films. Except for the special effects, it could have been made 15 or twenty years ago. Routh was excellent casting as a successor to Reeve, and has a similar look and voice -- what little we hear of it. (Poor newcomer Routh is hardly given any lines to work with, and those few he has are less than super.) Unfortunately, there are a few significant flaws which prevent the film from being really good. The pacing is a bit off, and the movie could be trimmed by 15 minutes without losing anything but time. That's a bit forgivable, but a larger problem is off-key characterizations and relationships. Superman, always before a paragon of virtue, is shown performing a certain morally questionable activity (which is acceptable) but without showing any uncertainty or remorse (which is not). Also, any relationship between Clark and Lois seems to have been completely forgotten in the years since we last saw them. Where before, Lois had obvious affection for Clark, if only as a geeky brother or emasculate platonic friend, she now barely acknowledges his existence.Most of the other characters are similarly off-key. Routh and Spacey are eerily reminiscent of Reeve and Hackman in their portrayals, but the rest of the cast seemed to just miss the mark.I would say I would look forward to a director's cut, but the problems with the film should have been caught by the director before it hit the screen.However, if you're not a die-hard fan of the comics or the original movies, then you probably won't be terribly disappointed with this film. Of course, if you're not a big fan of the comics or original films, you probably won't be that interested in this one either...",3,5,mb_webguy,"Jul 2, 2006",

I've been a fan of Superman for over 20 years enjoying the variations in character, script, and storyline. I will admit one thing is that the screenwriters certainly stuck to the history of Superman; however, than in itself is the biggest flaw of this movie. Basically, it's flat out boring, trite, and an insult to our creative minds. Brandon did a fabulous job mimicking the essence of Clark Kent, but Spacey was an utter waste as a villain and I will completely cast blame on a horrendous script. There was nothing compelling in the story line. The direction from our X-men fellow was contrived and left me cold in the theater.

5,"Earnest, devoted and boring","I really wanted to like this movie, and I give Bryan Singer full marks for his devotion to Superman, Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve. I also commend him for injecting a lot of human story into what could have been yet another bland, non-stop action summer movie.But alas, all his earnestness has resulted in a movie that is too self-important, too serious and too long.Brandon Routh does a reasonable job at invoking Christopher Reeve, but Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is too young and can't hold a candle to Margot Kidder's sassy, love-struck super sleuth.The plot has so many holes, it's like watching a movie built on styrofoam. Lex Luthor creates a continent so uninhabitable that he thinks he's going to control the world? And just who, pray tell, gave him the title deed to this hideous island anyway? How does he intend to persuade the rest of the world that he ""owns"" it?In another moment of silliness, Superman's super-suit can withstand bullets, but it's literally ripped off him with ease in a later scene. I could go on, but don't want to get into spoiler territory.I don't mean to be cruel, because as I said, you can see the love that Bryan Singer and his cast and crew put into it. It's immaculately made, but ultimately bloated and dreary. A super shame.",8,9,Mrhu,"Jul 2, 2006",
8,A super return for the Man of Steel,"Very faithful revival of the Superman movies; accomplishing a delicate balance between adapting information we've seen in the Christopher Reeve movies, and blending it with new story line elements. In short, this movie is a hybrid of remake and sequel, and pulls it off well.We meet a modern Superman (Brandon Routh) existing in the early 21st Century, yet endowed with the classic positive personality traits that have made the character so endearing by his many predecessors in the role. Routh not only resembles Reeve, but captures the friendly, boyishly charming, and kind hearted nature that Reeve brought to Superman.Kate Bosworth shines as the finest Lois Lane ever, capturing her ability to adapt to any challenge with an understated strength that is not in-your-face style, yet imposing all the same. It's easy to believe her as the resourceful reporter who touches the heart of the Man of Steel. The restrained power of their rekindled romance is appropriate to their situation, and you wonder how kind fate will be to them this time. The Lois/Superman chemistry has never been better. Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor is magnificent. At once absurdly funny and malevolently vicious, Spacey's Luthor is equal to Gene Hackman's terrific job in the same role.The movie is successful in every area that counts: writing, directing, and acting. The airplane sequence is one of the most creative collection of scenes ever, especially its surprise ending location.The movie has done a more than an adequate job of taking a character that has been an icon for 70 years, while somehow contributing something new of artistic merit to the legacy. Highly recommended.",1,1,MartianOctocretr5,"Jul 2, 2006",
10,Excellent!,"Thank goodness we have a director like Bryan Singer and a studio like Warner Brothers that has the cajones to stay true to the original source material. It shows great respect for the audiences that grew up with both the Christopher Reeve movies and the George Reeves TV series. Warner Brothers could have easily gone the alternate route and made this into a ""reimagination"" project. The word itself is scary, recent projects like Wild Wild West, Battlestar Galactica and The Dukes of Hazzard (yes I know Warner Bros. had their hands on a couple of those but this time they got it right). I only wish Bryan Singer would go back to his original intent and do a bigscreen Battlestar Galactica (the continuation angle that he developed).

Other than the great action sequences and the superb direction the acting in the film was excellent.

The music by John Ottoman is a pure tribute to John Williams old score, he brings Williams beautiful scores to life with beautiful vocals and incredible instrumental scores, though adds his touch in as well.

6,Overall : Superman is A Great Film,"I saw the Preview Last Night and I got to tell you that I really enjoyed this film. Too many people are underestimating these brilliant actors, just from what they have seen on the trailers. Kevin Spacey seemed like a horrible Lex Luthor from what the Commercials but out, but in fact he does a great job portraying Luthor in this rendition of Superman. Brandon Routh did an outstanding job as Clark Kent/Superman. So did Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen, without Sam in the film I'd think that it would have been weaker. Just because Sam brings basically all the comedy to the film. Also, James Marsden does a decent job as Richard White, Lois Lane's boyfriend. Child actor Tristan Lake Leabu did a good job as Jason White, Lois' and James' child. It was also nice to see Marlon Brando in the role Jor-El for 1 last time, that was really unique. The only thing about the film that falls short is Kate Bosworth, because compared to all the other actors in the film she is nothing. Her acting does fall short at times, but not so much as too ruin or bring down the movie. The only flaw of this film would have to be that it is 20 Minutes longer than it should have been. Finally, the effects from Superman Returns, were so amazing and astounding, that you will only get to see such magnificent entertainment from this film, if you see it in Theatres.",4,2,Tyler_Seymour_Wallach,"Jul 3, 2006",
4,They should have stopped after the opening credits...,"...because it was quite possibly the best part of the movie. I had high hopes for this film with Singer (who did a stellar job with the X-Men franchise) and Spacey attached to the project. Alas, this movie can only be termed as a disappointment. The movie was far too long for the little progression that happened in the plot. The plot mistakes are many, with an extremely illogical scene towards the film's conclusion that will make you slap yourself in the face for it's stupidity. Plus the chemistry between Routh and Bosworth was practically non-existent. To be fair, the action sequences are very well done, Superman's first appearance is absolutely breathtaking, but these scenes can only do so much for a film even when done this well. As I stated previously, they should have stopped after the opening title with John Williams's excellent score, it would have made the film far better in my eyes.Bottom Line: See it if you must, but do not expect much.",3,5,zdavis2512,"Jul 3, 2006",
10,a great movie,"With superman being emotionally disheartened (i.e. Lois moved on); we can relate to the man of steel, we feel what he is going through, we feel his pain about his love, Lois. This is VERY important with the story of Superman. See people like batman and spider-man because they are human and we can relate to their dilemmas. Since the man of steel has unbelievable powers no one can relate to someone perfect, his troubles cant be just minor struggles with villains, the audience needs some thematic element that makes them feel for superman, love. love is everything. I'm so glad this movie was not just a summer action movie, rather, a great story. Brandom Routh and Kate Bosworth are PERFECT, no exaggeration, they both look the part as well as bringing their own flare of how they think their roles should be played as well as displaying such professionalism for both being so young. Their roles as well as Spacey as Luthor were perfectly convincing. And then all this directed by Singer is amazing. all those downgrading this movie, think it through, imagine a different director, imagine someone else as Superman, it might have been Nicholas Cage.. dear God.

It utilized the blue screen in a way that would create a revolution in movie making style. Audience's actually thought Superman could really fly. Christopher Reeve became the modern day iconic physical representation of the comic character. None of the sequels ever captured what the first movie did.

What more can any Superman movie fan ask for? Kevin Spacey reminds us of Gene Hackman. Both actors of substantial caliber, with Spacey's Luther equitable, and just as wonderful.Iconic and Christ similarities? Sure. Similar to the first movie? You bet. A stale score? Heck no.

The look was interesting and the costume of Superman didn't fall into the high tech trap they the Batman suits have done. Special effects are so superior today that you cant even compare.

1,"So much potential, yet disappointing","Oh gads, what i could list that was horrible. Lets start from the beginning, they start off with some pathetic CGI, and continuing through the movie the cgi is continuously bad. In fact my high school friend has done CGI that could match the same quality. Next the actor for Superman/Clark Kent does not match the part, his acting was... blah... no emotion, then again the amount of lines that he had in the movie were VERY minimal, especially considering he is the alleged main character. Also it almost looks like they put on a muscle suit for when he was super man, which seemed to be the only change that was noticeable between him and his alter ego. This movie, of all the superman movies or shows, had the worst comparison, i mean it was so obvious that they were the same person, even their characterization seemed the same. There seemed no distinction between mild mannered reporter and super hero. For a two and a half hour movie, there was actually very little development and to much attempts on fancy shots of super man flying. The only characters that even seemed to develop were Lex Luthor and his girlfriend, who in fact i saw the most character development in. Which is pathetic because she is simply a supporting character, not even a villain mind you, but a simple supporting character. From what i gather the makers attempted to do a movie that both appealed to the comic/TV/old movie fans, so they could go off old stuff, as well as make a self sufficient movie. They failed at both for the sole reason that they attempted to do both. Also i saw way to many attempted biblical analogies. they were there and recognizable, but they seemed forced, and just didn't quite work. I rant and rave, and feel i should save you from any more of it. So thereby i rest my case. I mean it had SO MUCH potential. They could have made it great.

4,Mixed feelings on this one,"I went into this movie feeling extreme dread. I did not, in fact, plan to see it at all. Everything I read about this movie really made me want to avoid it. Still, I couldn't turn down a free ticket so I went to see it. Admitting that I went into this with a jaundiced eye, I came out not hating it as much as I expected. There were things I didn't like about it, but they were not the things I expected. All of the actors gave solid performances. I was actually surprised by the quality of Bosworth's performance. Though I had heard complaints that Spacey's Luthor was over-the-top, I didn't find it so. Routh did a credible job. His Clark was a bit clumsy (the portrayal of the character, not the character itself which is supposed to be a bit clumsy). So far as the acting goes, I really can't find anything I can't overlook. I have mixed feelings about the continuity between the first two Salkind movies and this. One way to look at it is that they were being respectful of the previous series. Another way to look at is that the best parts of Superman Returns are drawn directly from the previous works. I thought the story itself was simplistic, without even the depth of Superman 3 or 4. One objection I had going in and which did not change having seen the movie is the treatment of the Superman-Clark-Lois romance. While the stated goal may be to 'update' the material or add a touch of realism, it just seems to be trite Hollywood studio gimmickry. From my perspective, it's the same as taking the magic and romance out of the Arthurian legends. While it may be some people's cup of tea, I don't find it very interesting, and this is what was bubbling around in my brain as I walked out of Superman Returns.",0,0,dial5551212,"Jul 3, 2006",

I feel he incorporated some parts of Reeve's performance into his, but added his own feel to Superman to make the role his own. His Superman wasn't as soft (if that makes sense) as Reeve's and Brandon made his Superman a little edgier as well. Brandon was perfect in the role combining all of Superman's traits such as anger and vulnerability when it comes to Lois Lane and nailed his performance being so natural as Superman. He did a fine job as Clark Kent too.There's not much to say about Kevin Spacey, I expected him to be excellent and he certainly was! I was never a big fan of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor (yes, while he was funny to watch, he was never a convincing villain), so I was extremely happy to see that this Lex Luthor was much more evil. Spacey managed to keep Lex as the wisecracking Lex we saw in the previous Superman movies, but also was a lot more threatening and menacing which was convincing as the insane evil genius that is Lex Luthor.Kate Bosworth - while there is a lot of negativity surrounding her performance as Lois Lane I feel she was perfect in the role and definitely surprised me the most and I was very satisfied with her performance. She shows us a more mature Lois Lane, which was a nice break from the over-confident, sometimes arrogant Lois Lane we've seen in previous portrayals who treat Clark Kent horribly for no particular reason (but the awkwardness in the Lois/Clark relationship was definitely there). While I am a fan of the sassy Lois Lane as well, the lack of one-liners from Bosworth's Lois does not detract from or ruin her performance. A lot of the negative comments coming towards her have to do with how young she is (23). I think if more people would look past the fact that she's 23 and focus on her performance they'd see how amazing her performance as Lois was. I give her kudos as well for not copying Margot Kidder, which would have been tempting.The Superman and Lois chemistry was present throughout the entire film, in my opinion topping the chemistry between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder.My only complaint would have to do with the Kitty character. I blatant clone of the Eve Teschmacher character from the original Superman movies. The actress playing Kitty did a wonderful job and I liked her character, but I have no idea why they felt the need to call her Kitty and just not bring back the Eve Teschmacher name.All in all, an excellent film not to be missed!",2,2,fragile_day,"Jul 3, 2006",
10,The title says it all!,"When I heard that Bryan Singer had left X-Men 3 to make a new Superman film, I had mixed emotions. Superman as a character was far less interesting to me because, Richard Donner's films aside, he seemed to lack a certain humanity that was waiting there to be exploited with the X-Men. Well, Singer should be brought in to direct every superhero film henceforth, because if there is one thing he excels at, it is taking the humanity of an extraordinary character and making an intelligent audience rally behind that. Superman Returns is everything that X-Men 3 should have been, almost everything that X-Men 2 was, and then some. Particularly in testament to Singer's skill as a filmmaker is that Superman Returns is neither better than nor inferior to Donner's 1978 adaptation. It is equal, and most importantly, *different*, a quality that will have Bryan Singer on a pedestal long after directors like Brett Ratner, Richard Lester, or Joel Schumacher are nothing more than some bad memory that true cinemaphiles only experience like a mild toothache.Only two problems mar this new film, and they are very minor in the grand scheme of things. First of all, the first thirty or so minutes of Superman Returns feel borderline incoherent, as Singer attempts to set up where Superman has been in the past twenty years, and why he is back. I get the feeling that Warners asked Singer to cut thirty minutes from the film, and Singer felt that the setup/exposition early on was the best place. While this does create a disjointed feel early on, Singer's judgement in this matter is as solid as his judgement that he is the best person to resurrect one of the most thoroughly-killed tentpole franchises in history. Once the film settles down into a groove, about the time that Lois goes to cover an experimental space shuttle launch that has to be seen to be believed, Singer delivers scene after scene in which Superman's human core is blended almost seamlessly with his über-human abilities. Only Bryan Singer would invent a scene in which Superman explains why Humanity needs him by pointing out all the cries of anguish that he can hear and Lois cannot.Speaking of Lois, I had mixed expectations when I knew that Kate Bosworth would be portraying her. I need not have worried, for Bosworth hits the nail on the head more times than a pneumatic hammer. Where Margot Kidder was a screechy, whiny prop for Christopher Reeve to rescue and bounce dialogue off, Bosworth becomes an integral part of the plot, and helps the plot move about in ingenious ways. James Marsden has a surprisingly expansive role as Richard White, the man Lois marries whilst Superman is off exploring what might be left of Krypton. Marsden does the side a big favour by portraying a simple human being, in a manner that speaks volumes about the species and why Superman wants to help them out. As they say, however, a hero is only as good as the antagonist, and Kevin Spacey provides one as effective as those of Brian Cox or Ian McKellen. I would even rate him as better in the role of Lex Luthor than Gene Hackman, simply because he gives the character a sleazy charm in place of a tiresome tendency to do nothing but put down those he considers inferior.Brandon Routh has the most thankless task of the film, which is ironic, given that he is the titular character. The Superman of Superman Returns is much like that portrayed by Christopher Reeve in four films. He speaks in an economy of words, is charming when he is being friendly, and still charming when he is exercising imposition. What makes Routh stand out is his performance as Clark Kent. Rather than emphasise the bumbling, farcical nature of the character, Clark in Superman Returns is a regular guy who just happens to be rather large. Singer and Routh play the character as if he is already aware that he does not need to apologise for his presence, which makes the transitions into the character of Superman all the more believable. Just as Superman the character finds a whole new strength in being grounded and real, so too does Kent. The issue of how people can look at Superman and not see Kent is still left without exploration, but Brandon is so effective in both roles that this issue takes a big back seat. This man could go places if he manages to avoid the traps that Reeve fell into.The only other problem I have with Superman Returns is that this is the first Bryan Singer film in which I have noticed the use of shaky-cam. In the interiors of vehicles when they are about to crash, or whatever the situation may be, the camera shakes about like a dog being electrocuted, and it throws one right out of the film. So, a memo to Singer: you are better than this. Fortunately, what Singer also brings to the film is a rousing score that recycles John Williams' signature theme, but replaces everything else with new compositions by John Ottman, who also edited the film. Although he tends to be bombastic at times when subtlety would suit the on screen action better, he also gives the film a quality where one could switch off the dialogue altogether, and still make sense of the story. Speaking of which, the special effects, although totally necessary to depict Superman's trademark abilities, are given exactly the kind of emphasis they need. In other words, they never get in the way of the story being told.I gave Superman Returns a ten out of ten. By shifting the focus of his film, Bryan Singer makes Superman as miraculous as he was in 1978. See it twice to get a good idea of what a superhero film done right looks like.",10,6,mentalcritic,"Jul 3, 2006",
7,Gertrude goes down,"Greetings again from the darkness. This has to be one of the toughest franchises to cover, if for no other reason than the scrutiny from the mass of comic book and film devotees. Listening to these fanatics argue over the details of the boots and hair style will convince anyone that there is a certain responsibility for those involved with the project.Starting with the highest profile spot, TV bit role actor Brandon Routh provides the beefiest, darkest Superman yet. Sadly, Routh is infinitely more effective as Clark Kent than as the Caped Crusader. Part of this is the strange filter, director Singer used in filming. It makes his face look plastic - almost as if it is a store bought toy. The good news is, Routh is passable and does not bring the movie down. Does he come across as heroic? Not really. But he is not a major distraction either.The choice of Bryan Singer as director had many fans anxious from the day it was announced. His ""X-Men"" films put style over substance and really emphasize special effects. ""Superman Returns"" is right in line with this. It is a very pleasant movie to watch, in fact the sound is terrific. The special effects are kept to a minimum and two really stand out. Both the city crumbling scenes and the yacht disaster are very well done, action packed and not overly long. Where Singer misses are the ""slower"" scenes such as Superman and Lois' reunion tour of the city. It felt like 20 minutes, even though it was probably only 5.The real downside to the film is Kate Bosworth (""Remember the Titans"" ""Beyond the Sea""). Although, I didn't think it possible, she is every bit as horrible as Katie Holmes was in ""Batman Begins"". First of all, can anyone explain why this movie is based 5 years later, but Lois, Jimmy and Superman all appear YOUNGER? In fact, Margot Kidder (excellent as Lois Lane in 1978) was 30 when she first played Lois and Bosworth is 23. That in itself does not stifle the movie, but Bosworth's performance certainly does.As for the rest, there was entirely too much Jimmy Olsen in the first half. The entire plane sequence with Bosworth being tossed around like ice cubes in a blender is ludicrous. Not even a headache or bruise? Kevin Spacey has some brilliant scenes as Lex Luthor, but fans need to know this is an entirely different take than Gene Hackman's. Parker Posey has a couple of really cool moments, but mostly she just stands around batting her eyes. James Marsden (Cyclops from ""X-Men"") is fairly nondescript as Lois Lane's live-in mate and Perry White's (Frank Langella) nephew. Nice to see Eva Marie Saint as Clark's childhood mom (although the orange lipstick in the hospital scene was brutal). Pretty rare to see two actors born in 1928 make a mark on a film these days. In addition to Ms. Saint, Marlon Brando makes an appearance (archive footage from 1978) as Jar-El, Superman's dad.In one of the endless stream of tributes, Jack Larson and Noel Neill make brief appearances. In the original ""Adventures of Superman"" Larson was Jimmy Olsen and Neill was Lois Lane. Singer casts them here as a bartender and dying millionaire widow, who Lex Luthor scams out of her estate in order to fund his global takeover.Overall, a pretty true and fun adaptation of the brand without too many risks. Kids and adults can enjoy this one, even though it was a missed opportunity to give us some real depth in analyzing what Superman went through for the past 5 years.",2,3,ferguson-6,"Jul 3, 2006",
7,"Grand, bombastic, and entertaining revival","Congratulations to Bryan Singer for making another film, under challenging conditions, that meets his own relatively high standards. Congratulations to Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth, who fill a couple pairs of sizable shoes very well. Congratulations to Kevin Spacey for proving, once again, his versatility and competence within an ensemble cast. And finally, congratulations to Michael Dougherty and the rest of the writing team for Superman Returns, who have done the seemingly impossible by blending together several elements taken from disparate Superman stories over seventy or so years of the character's development in several DC comics titles into a true-to-character, intelligently written and themed, blend of romance and wild world-saving action.I can hear the film snobs now - ""just what we need, another bombastic action flick loaded with CGI and cliché in place of a 'SERIOUS' human story."" Yup, it's a bombastic action flick. Yes, it is crammed with special effects. And yes, if you consider simple and largely unexamined human emotions to be cliché, then Superman Returns is loaded with clichés. My advice to the film snobs is - don't review films you are predisposed to dislike. If you do not have a standard from which you are able to measure the worth of a certain genre, then you have no business reviewing in that genre.Let's examine this rationally. The whole point of the character of Superman is to provide a fantastic superhuman persona who is so alien and so vastly superior in terms of physical being, knowledge, and morality, that he becomes a mirror through which we are forced to critically examine our own social, political, emotional, and health problems. What kinds of problems would such a vastly superior being trouble himself with? Well, guess what, he might not have time for the day to day subtleties of social and sexual intrigues and ambiguities, the role of the media in political rhetoric or other ""SERIOUS"" concerns plaguing the modern intellectual elite. Superman is concerned with more fundamental issues such as whether half the world's population is going to live out the day. Yet he still manages to find time to rekindle a dysfunctional relationship with love interest Lois Lane, and to be inspired to prove himself with a flourish of light-speed heroic antics to regain his esteem among a people whose cynicism and self-contempt have apparently gotten the better of them (film snobs all?). in fact, he even MAKES MISTAKES!!!!Kal-El returns to earth just in time to confront his old arch-nemesis Lex Luther's plot to rebuild a chunk of Krypton off the coast of New Jersey as his own continent. He must also unexpectedly confront his own feelings for the people of earth and, in particular, for Lois Lane, now an unmarried mother with an asthmatic kid and a smoking habit. Lois is also engaged to a good guy, very competently acted by James Marsden, but the paternity of her son is suspect. Considering the fact that this is a ""bombastic action film"" a remarkable amount of time is taken up with developing the relationships between these characters and exploring their effects on one another. And at times, you even get the feeling that at least some of Superman's heroism is inspired by his feelings for Lois.The bigger problem is that Luther has Kryptonite, and plenty of it, and so, Superman is mortally vulnerable and must fight for his own life as well as those of his adoptive species.Ignore the geological inaccuracies (which are plenty), forget about the occasional continuity problems, and let yourself get sucked up into this very fine and well crafted example of the superhero action genre. If you're a hardened film snob, it's worth the effort of wriggling out of your fossilized suit of cynical armor just long enough to see what the value of a film with a positive, simple, message might be.",297,266,mstomaso,"Jul 3, 2006",

Yeah, Brandon Routh isn't Christopher Reeve, but he is Superman. He is Clark Kent. There's no question that the casting for this role was perfect. The rest of the cast was really good as well. The only thing I missed was the likableness that Gene Hackman brought to Lex Luther. But Spacey does get the evilness of the character just right.From opening to closing, this movie has been everything I've been waiting for since that steaming pile known as Superman IV came out. I'm interested in seeing where the sequels to the new movie will go. The great thing about this movie was its willingness to take the Superman myth into unfarmiliar territory.

9,What a great film both in Imax and not.  However...,"I first saw Superman Returns on opening day. I could only think of one word, Awesome. However a couple of times I found Superman himself looking a little too CG for my taste. I have seen this in countless other films and always to a much worse degree than Bryan Singers masterpiece. This film was so good, that I had no trouble at all letting the two sub par moments of CG slip past without ever looking back.The second time I saw SR, was the night of July 3rd, and this time I saw it in Imax 3D. While sitting in the theater surrounded by loud inconsiderate patrons, a woman who was never taught to cover her mouth or turn her head when she coughs, a young man who could not control the tapping of his feet, and another woman who seemed to think that shaking her bag of candy and her cup of ice during critical moments in the film helped to enhance the sound, I found the film to not only be better in general than the first time I saw it, but an entirely new movie. The 3D was done brilliantly and added an entirely new element to the film.So sorry for venting on here about my movie going experience, but this is not a rare occurrence for me. It seems that every time I go to the movies it's getting worse.The bottom line is that Superman was such a great movie that not even hacking, chomping, shaking, tapping, talking people surrounding could not take me out of it.

All the parts were extremely well cast, and Brandon Routh, though a nobody, fit the new superman well. He was a nerdy Clark Kent, but not over the top, and a heroic superman. Sam Huntington, whom some of you may remember as Mimi-Siku in Jungle 2 Jungle, played a hilarious Jimmy Olsen. The story was captivating throughout the whole movie, and the technology creates spectacular scenes. Superman returns from his flight to Krypton, his home planet, after five years and has to repair some of his relationships. Simultaneously, Lex Luthor is let out of jail and obtains a large some of money and property to begin his next attempt to destroy superman and become powerful.

The stroyline revolves around a bad thing that happens to Superman that causes him to leave. Lex plots to destroy the world and Superman is brought back to save the world-again.

It was a great movie filled with action and emotion, the characters were pitch perfect although yes, Bosworth looked a bit young. The problem was that Luthor should not have been the main and solo villain. Since this movie acknowledges Superman and Superman 2 as backstory, we've already seen Luthor going for a landgrab scam and using kryptonite on him. That being said, I am usually annoyed by kid parts (Blues Brother 2000, anyone?) but this kid didn't annoy me given they were acknowleding a history he had. It may not be how we think Superman's life should turn out, but sometimes life is life, and it just happens. I look more forward to Sueprman Returns II, hopefully with more colorful villains and schemes, and no General Zod. Again, been there done that. Note to producers...

8,Superman is Back!,"Superman has returned and what a return it is. Bryan Singer, the man who brought amazing cult classics like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Apt Pupil"" and then went on to bring us the ""X-Men"" franchise has the utmost respect for the ""Man of Steel."" Singer has done for Superman what Christopher Nolan did for Batman. Didn't change his imagery rather focus on the things that make Superman so ""Super."" I have a confession to make; I was on the boat of many people not approving of this project when I heard it was being made. It hit a sore spot being Christopher Reeve, the original motion picture Superman had passed and I felt it was disrespectful to many of us comic book era readers. Could I have been more wrong? The film picks up years after ""Superman II"" ends. Superman has left Earth in search of his own identity on planet Krypton. During this duration Lois Lane has won the Pulitzer Prize for her acclaimed article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman"" and has moved on to build a family. She has a son and is in a non-matrimonial relationship with the Chief's nephew. Superman returns to Metropolis and has come to find out that a world has learned to live without him both in safety and security. Also, he learns that the diabolical Lex Luthor beat the system upon Superman's absence and is planning a scheme to take over the world and rid ""The Man of Steel"" for good.What makes Superman so ""super""? His powers are a definite big part of it but Singer focuses on Superman's inner battle with Clark Kent. Clark's awkwardness around Lois Lane, his subtlety upon entering a room, and his mannerisms that show the dark force that is embedded inside of him is all portrayed brilliantly by newcomer Brandon Routh. Routh nailed Superman perfectly from all of the mannerisms to the way he speaks. His delivery of lines could have brought a Reeve family member to tears because you can see Christopher Reeve just peaking out of him. His study of the character is remarkable and makes a lot of Superman fans very proud.I was not excited about hearing that a young Kate Bosworth was chosen as Lois Lane. As the film continues on I got used to her in the role and she brought forth an admirable effort but she was no Margot Kidder. Lois Lane's battle with Superman has to do with his exit of earth without a thought or a word which leads her to write her prize-winning article. Bosworth gives Lois a life unlike in the others. Her feelings for Superman, love for her child and battle with marriage are tackled very well thanks to Bosworth.The rest of the supporting cast is magnificent. Sam Huntington as Jimmy is uplifting and a great comic relief as always. James Marsden as Lane's romantic partner is both great and sympathetic to the story. Frank Langella is a noble presence to the cast after just having a comeback success on George Clooney's ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" Langella is the Chief of the newspaper and makes a fine addition to a vastly unknown cast. Parker Posey is Kitty Kowalski, the girl-toy of the villainous Lex Luthor, who grabs her own inner battle throughout the film. But the standout of the film could be, no other, than the two-time Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey. He is like stated before diabolical, treacherous, villainous, wicked, and completely malevolent. Spacey is the pitch perfect best choice of the cast for playing their role. Gene Hackman was high-quality as Luthor but Spacey brings something we haven't seen before. We see in his eyes, his true hate for the Man of Steel, and his true willingness to take over the planet. It's definitely one of the best villainous performances of recent years.The special effects, sound, sound editing and everything you can think of mechanically of the film is flawless and unspoiled. The scene of Superman regaining his identity and taking on a falling airplane should be enough to gather consideration of three Oscars. John Williams' score in the opening credits are enough to pump you up for an enjoyable but rather long ride. The film rides on for two hours and thirty-four minutes and gets a little ""draggy"" in some spots but never did I feel compelled to hate, walk out or blink to see what was going to happen next. The film is a huge success and campaigning for Oscars should deal with it's effects and if their feeling extra bold, a supporting nomination for Kevin Spacey with a directing nod for Bryan Singer. Why Singer? Singer for bringing one of the best heroes of modern time to a century full of CGI, THX, and thought-provoking enhancements and still with holding all the respect for the franchise and a man who brought him to life; Christopher Reeve.

The music brings an additional heroic touch to the legacy that superman has.As for the cast, Kevin Spacey proved to be one of the best actors by portraying the character of Lex Luthor by being a a vicious, manipulative person.

As for Brandon Routh, it was annoying that throughout the movie, he kept reminding me of Tom Cruise. He played the role of Clark Kent pretty well.

Routh is still young and he has still a lot to learn, but I believe that he shouldn't play the ""charming"" card too often.If you were not a superman fan, you might find the movie long or over-rated. But if you are a superman fan, then this is a must see movie as it proved to be worth waiting and it has what every superman fan dreams of.one more thing..I think that this superman is racist.He only listens to problems in North America and Europe.

A reflection of 2006 Hollywood's moral vacuum, Superman is reduced to a liberal girlie-man, without values; just nothing. While this sequel is not as dreadful as Peter Jackson's horrid King Kong mess, it's lack of mainstream American values dooms it to the ashcan of good ideas gone bad. For the record, the greatest Superman movie was the 1948 Columbia 15-part serial; made on a shoestring budget with very basic but nonetheless effective special effects, from Krypton's destruction to the final moment in Chapter 15, it was always engrossing, never forgot it was a comic strip movie, and was 100% faithful to the DC Comics concept.

9,superhero of great character,"Those who wants plain action in a movie, Superman is not for you because this movie has more heart and value that viewers of simple standard for entertainment find it boring (because they tag ""great"" movie just for the fight scenes). It is unlike other superhero movies that is full of fight scenes, destructions, and other non-sense stuffs but the storyline sucks that at the end of the movie, a lot of things do not make sense. Superman is a superhero who is an alien but is driven by compassion for the human race, a race that is not his own. He is one Superhero that not only has the muscle, the power, the superhuman strength, THE MOST HANDSOME FACE AND BODY, but his most valuable asset is his strength of character (that his human parents influenced him with)and his deep sense of responsibility & value for mankind (which his biological father taught). With this excellent combination, he his considered the leader of many other superheros. HIS CHARACTER IS HIS STRENGTH that is why the underlying tone of the movie is not just to show off his abilities (thru action and fight scenes) but also to bring out CHARACTER VALUES that many people nowadays would consider boring, non-essential, and find it hard to comprehend (because good values are ""alien"" to them). SUPERMAN RETURNS is not for the simpletons but for those who has the brains and the heart---both are essential. I admire the people behind the movie because they showed RESPECT (another dyeing character of the human race) to the original movies of Superman when they continued on with the original storyline.

The recycled Williams musical score, use of Brando footage, and cliché references to the 1978 Richard Donner Superman movie pay tribute to more than just the director and composer of the original movie, but also respect the groundbreaking work of Christopher Reeve.Still, despite the pleasant nostalgia, the movie still disappoints even the most die hard DC Comics fans.Brian Singer wanted to paint his own canvas. This, his select cast of nobodies (the worst being Kate Bosworth & Sam Huntington), and the tribute to the 1978 Donner film seems to have lengthened and compromised the potential for Kal-El's return to Hollywood. Someone should tell the director that there are many more plot devices and epic Superman enemies at his disposal than just Lex Luthor. Still, since using LL seemed inevitable, many (including myself) would like to have seen Singer work with at least some of the Smallville cast. Nobody plays Lex Luthor better than Michael Rosenbaum from this smash series. The use of religious imagery and innuendo was disturbing and distracting. Superman was never penned a ""savior"" - rather just a Hero who wanted to give back something to his adopted home world. Politically, Superman now stands for, ""Truth, Justice ... all that stuff"" instead of the ""American way"". Singer's liberalism is difficult to veil in his painting of a Hero who is quintessentially American.Artistic license comes at a price. Apparently for this film it was 260 million dollars. I really hope Warner Brothers makes it back. My local grocer: Stop and Shop has already begun shelving the action figures. The die hards will purchase the DVD. Ironically, Singer may need to pray that WB breaks even if there is any hope to carry newcomer Routh into a sequel. Indeed, I hope the next one soars well enough to carry us with it.",0,0,DELLsFan,"Jul 3, 2006",
10,John Williams is Superman,"I expected this to be a great movie...and that can lead to either a very good theater experience or a terrible one. Its a bold move to even try to make a sequel to a series which has already made its claim to excellence. Props to Mr. Singer...props to everyone. This film was a knockout punch. I want to give some credit to John Williams too. You know your musical score is masterful when remakes have included it. John Williams is the best movie music composer of all time. Does anyone remember the theme to Star Wars?...Jaws?..E.T.?...The Original Superman?? Yep...John Williams. His original score is played throughout this movie, making an already great superhero revival film into an epic adventure that wont soon be forgot.And by the way if you all read Roger Eberts reviews, u must be crazy cuz he is never right!

10,Superman Has Returned!!!,"I have read comic books since I was a little kid. I have alway been fascinated with the idea of duality in these mythological characters. To me Superman is the ideal example of this and this film gave new light to the Superman mythos as well as making the character more human.Bryan Singer should direct every superhero movie! This guy really has a good grounding on where the character comes from and how he relates to our world.I have alway been a huge fan of the Dick Donner Superman film made in 1978. To me it is the greatest of all superhero films. I t is epic and the effects still hold up today. I must say that I was glad to see that Singer didn't decide to make a remake, but just continue to build on the first two classic films. Christopher Reeve has always been the quintessential Superman, but I have to admit, that despite my initial disdain for for the casting of Brandon Routh, he is a close second. The sincerity that he showed was excellent and I was very impressed with his acting ability.Kate Bosworth was a better Lois Lane to me than Margot Kidder with all due respect. One; she is ten time better looking, and two; I think she really had a grip on the character from the comics book.Kevin Spacey was ideal as Lex Luthor. The simultaneous wit and pure evil was well communicated and funny.The special effects were some of the best that I have seen in a long time. I read some of these other reviews and I think judging the scientific plausibility of some of these sequences is plain ludicrous. It's a movie for God's sakes!!! Another subtle thing that I like was how this movie sort of blended with Batman Begins. I think a ""World's Finest"" movie could be awesome. Christian Bale and Brandon Routh seem like they will play off each other well.The story of the film avoided a lot of common clichés which I was happy to see. The score was astounding and it was an overall fun and uplifting movie that was true to it's film and comic book predecessors. Well done Mr. Singer and Mr. Routh!",1,2,pinkpeach47,"Jul 3, 2006",
8,Superman soars..!!!,"Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"" is an outstanding movie. It brought me back to 1978 where I viewed Richard Donner's original for the very first time. My problem with Donner's film is that it became too campy in scenes regarding Lex Luther. Kevin Spacey's Lex Luther is a worthy adversary for the Man of Steel. He's a darker foe and much more menacing.""Superman Returns"" could have been better with tighter editing. There were moments during the movie when I said to myself: ""OK, get on with it."" However, when the movie works it simply explodes! 'Superman Returns"" deals with a hero who could never be a part of us. He will always be an outsider. Consider Jor-El's tacit warning: ""Even though you've been raised as a human, you are not one of them."" This is a story about dealing with rejection and burdensome responsibility.Yes, Brandon Routh brings back memories of Christopher Reeve. It was bound to happen and Routh does an exceptional job.

,considering the wait it should have been so much more,"Lavish but meandering comic book adaptation from X-Men director Bryan Singer. Having been on his home planet and spent years away from Earth, the heroic man of steel Superman and his alter ago Clark Kent return to thwart the plan of an evil megalomaniac (Spacey), but more importantly to try and reclaim the love of former girlfriend and co-worker Lois Lane (Bosworth). Unbeknownst to him, she's already moved on with her life and his return only exacerbates the situation. Highly anticipated to be sure, especially given director Singer's recent track record, but this bland and expositionless saga offers little beyond elaborate special effects; action scenes really fall short in excitement, the two leads fail to generate any real chemistry, and star Routh's ""performance"" is anemic. Co-star Bosworth is unremarkable as his love interest, and the ever-impressive Spacey adds little to the proceedings as the vile and eccentric Lex Luthor.

And I'm someone who in childhood, with change jangling in my pocket, waited at the newsstand for the newest Superman comics to be delivered on Tuesdays and Thursdays.Brandon Routh has the air of an Eagle Scout, but no depth, as Superman.

10,Superman flies high in 2006,"It is amazing that the through the years that the superman genre keeps getting stronger each time. Kirk Alyn first adorned the outfit in the superman serials in the 40's, then came George Reeves in The Adventures Of Superman(1952-1958), The late 1970's came 24 year old Christopher Reeve to wear the suit in the big budgeted Superman feature film, and would later reprise that role in three more sequels. The late 80's came the hit show Superboy(1988-1992), first played by John Newton, and later by Gerard Christopher. Then Dean Cain would donn the tights, in Lois and Clark:The New Adventures Of Superman(1993-1997). In 2001 came the hit show Smallville, the show that reflected on Supermans teenage years before the costume, played by Tom Welling, and it is still going strong.Now its 2006, and newcomer Brandon Routh Donn's the outfit as The man of steel. Superman returns to earth after five years away, as reclaims his old job as a reporter, and finds Lois Lane is engaged and has a kid from a previous marriage. Lois has mixed reactions about seeing him again. But Lex Luther has a crazy plan of his own.This film tries to bring back to the magic, that made the first Superman a hit. Brandon Routh doesn't do an imitation of Christopher Reeve, but plays Superman/Clark Kent at the same level that Reeve played it. Kate Bosworth was great as Lois Lane, but she did not have quite the quirkiness that Margot Kidder had. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was well played, more demented, not humorers this time.

3,Save Your Money,"For anyone who thinks that a 'comic book' character must, necessarily, be drawn in the most shallow respects imaginable, when brought to the screen, I have one word for you... Batman.There's a 'tradition' in Hollywood whereby a writer, called in to 'fix' some out-of-control picture, decides to bail out, and, assuming he/she has the Agent, the cash, and the 'pull', can actually have their names withdrawn from the so-called credits. It's not nearly as simple as all that for an actor wishing to slip out the back door, of course, given that their faces and voices are recognizable...and with that I offer my heartfelt condolences to Kevin Spacey and Frank Langella. With ""Superman Returns"" in his filmography, Mr. Spacey has probably single-handedly prevented any fisticuffs in arty film classes over arguments regarding his worst film ever. Thank you, Mr. Spacey.As for the fellow in the title role; anyone who thinks this guy is an actor, in the technical sense, must also be eagerly awaiting the handing of the Academy Award to one of those gay jocks in the Gillette razor commercials. It could happen, sure...The dialogue is a fine piece of work, and was obviously out-sourced to George Lucas, a fellow who has proved he knows nothing about the human species, nor its attempts to communicate. Tough luck for the 'nominal' writers, though, but, that's what happens when you don't have the clout to withdraw unobtrusively from a bomb under construction.From the over-wrought soundtrack, through the poorly-developed subplots, to the waste of celluloid over the Lois & Clark 'issue', which nobody cares about, anyway... it just has first-one-off-the-cliffs-of-Summer, written all over it, from end-to-end.Avoid.",14,27,BrianStegner,"Jul 3, 2006",

9,Superman Soars,"SUPERMAN THE MOVIE with Christopher Reeve is a better movie...Yes the Special Effects are not nearly as good...Though for it's day it looked amazing. This Superman is deeper, more cerebral, more sophisticated. It is beautiful to look at and wonderful to behold. SUPERMAN RETURNS is what going to the movies is supposed to be. An entertaining, captivating two and half hours that leaves you wanting more. Bryan Singer is to be commended. He has truly outdone himself. And the casting? Top notch. Brandon Routh was a truly wonderful SUPERMAN/Clark Kent. He brought exactly what Christopher Reeve brought to the role. Seriousness. Believability. Honesty. Kate Bosworth, who never really caught my eye as an actress shows that shes the real deal here. Her Lois Lane is different than Margot Kidder, with the same frailties and spelling problems. Not to mention the chemistry she and Brandon Routh had together. Pure magic. The relationship, the longing between the two, really worked. And her being torn between SUPERMAN and her new fiancé...Fantastic. As Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey does a fine job, not really as BIG as Gene Hackman's performance, and that may be due to the fact that they really didn't give him enough to do. I thought the subplot with Lex Luthor needed more development. We needed to see more of the irony of Luthor being out because of SUPERMAN's disappearance for five years. The Luthor subplot was merely okay, but could have been brought out and developed further. What this film was really about is the same thing that Bryan Singer fleshed out in his two X-MEN movies. The feeling of alienation. This SUPERMAN is more aware that he is, for all intents and purposes, alone in this world. He is the last one of his kind and it really hits home with him this time around, to beautiful effect I might add. He is caught between being who he is and wanting to be normal, what ever that is. And Brandon Routh does a beautiful job conveying that message. Overall this film is worth seeing more than once, I've already seen it twice and loved it more the second time around. It's truly epic film making.",1,2,Billyfilm,"Jul 3, 2006",

Besides Brandon Routh, I disagree with most of the casting. Kevin Spacey did alright as Lex Luthor only because he's a good actor, but it could have been so much better.The main problem with this movie was it didn't grab my attention. The overall plot wasn't too interesting, but the actions scenes (which were rare) were fun to watch. It could also be because this was supposed to be more of a chick-flick...To sum up, this movie would be a 6.5, but I rounded up.And for the idiots, who voted ""1,"" you're basically saying this movie was equivalent (or worse) than ""Glitter""?

This movie which should have been the action movie we expected it to be whimpered and became a soap opera in disguise. I have always loved and respected the Man of Steel and his associates, but this left me feeling I had been used as a ticket stub. Most of us remember the ""War of The Worlds"" which should have been truly great with the amount of PR and money that went into it, well Superman Returns should be compared to that one.

3,Looks like Superman did not Return,"The movie left me totally cold. I hated the story and thought there were way too many characters which took away time for development of the real characters. I mean why did Martha Kent show up at all? Langella's Perry White could have had bite, but was relegated to the background for the most part. I won't put any spoilers in, but the plot twists were just too ridiculous. The movie also went too far trying to pay homage to Chris Reeve. At times, I thought I was watching scenes from Superman 1 being redone. Come on, Mr. Singer, after the X-Men I really thought you and your writers would deliver more than this maudlin attempt to copy the first movie. In fact, at times Mr. Routh's resemblance to Chris distracted me from the movie. It was kind of creepy. I felt that Bosworth's Lois was weak. Kevin Costner could have done a better job as Lois than Bosworth. I did love Spacey as a darker more violent Luthor, but Kitty his new sidekick could have been played by an Ewok. None of the excitement and sex appeal of Ms. Tessmacher or the bumbling Otis's chemistry with Lex was apparent. One or two bright spots are in this flick, but overall it will appeal to the starry eyed fans of the franchise, which I used to count myself as one, more than to a more discriminating viewer. Bryan Singer disappoints in this poorly written movie, with wooden performances from Bosworth and poor character development.

He carries some of the same facial expressions especially as Clark at the beginning which ease you on into the movie. Kate Bosworth is never as annoying as Noel Neill or Margot Kidder or even Teri Hatcher and that's good and bad. I know others here liked Kevin Spacey but I think he was wasted here. The movie comes off like a lightweight but long TV episode and much good talent was wasted. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable.

10,"""Superman Returns"" is a long awaited return.","""Superman Returns"" is a very long awaited recreation of the cherished character, Superman. No actor could have replaced our beloved Chrisopher Reeves, however, Brandon Routh has done so in a way that gives a truly remarkable image of the cartoon character in real life. His handsome image, and his ability to replicate the stage business of Mr. Reeves is truly uncanny. I believe that Lex Luthor plated by Kevin Spacey is another sparkling star in his villainous role. He is perfectly cast and gives a very convincing performance. Such perfection has become expected of his great talents. Frank Langella plays Perry White the ever overbearing chief of the Daily Planet newspaper. He too is well cast.Kate Bosworth is Lois Lane, and although convincing in her performance, she is different than the usual character that we have become accustomed to over the years. Eva Marie Saint gives a surprisingly believable performance as Martha Kent. Parker Posey plays Kitty Kowalski, and is consistent in her dumb blonde portrayal. I think that he most powerful element in this movie is the referral to Superman as the Savior and the son of Jor-El. Indeed, there is even footage from the first film episode of Jor-El played by Marlon Brando. There is a particular consistency to the formation of the crucifix when Superman is flying with his arms outstretched. Perhaps this is stretching it, however, I feel that it was a prominent part of the movie and it remained secular in that no particular great religion was emphasized, just that everyone seems to yearn for some kind of a Savior, and in this case Superman fills the bill. Great special effects are a delight. Don't miss it. Dale Haufrect",1,2,dhaufrect,"Jul 3, 2006",
3,Too much like the original,"Superman Returns is set five years after Superman leaves to look for remains (and possibly other survivors) of his home world Krypton. He returns to find that the world has largely forgotten about him, or made a conscious effort to move on without him. Thus he begins the long journey back to win the hearts and the trust of the world once again (particularly Lois Lane, who writes an article about the Man of Steel leaving).However, Lex Luthor, having been released from jail, wants to exact his revenge on Superman, and devises a plan to rid the world of the man in the red cape once and for all.Now, I mentioned in the summary line that this is too much like the original series. I need to clarify what I mean by this. I have no doubt that Brandon Routh got this part mostly on his uncanny likeness to the late Christopher Reeve. But it seemed that through most of the movie the director and producers were not satisfied to have a guy that simply looked like him. It seemed as though they wanted Brandon to copy Christopher's likeness of the iconic character, right down to some of the mannerisms and even dialog. Now I understand that the character of Superman will have some continuity over the years, and that is necessary. However, I was hoping to see Brandon bring something of himself to the role, not simply a reprisal of the Christopher Reeve Superman.Kevin Spacey on the other hand brought something new to the role of Lex Luthor. He wasn't nearly as over-the-top as Gene Hackman (though I liked Gene Hackman's portrayal as well). I wish though that Routh was allowed to do the same.",0,1,ccole-7,"Jul 3, 2006",

I don't think it's as good as the first two, and it is IMHO in the same league as the 3rd, or 4th sequel. They had years to write a decent superman story, and this one fell straight off the edge, and down the pit right after his first heroic appearance. This one was not it. I thought it would have looked and read good on the comic page, but it wasn't a good comic translation into a feature. It didn't have that type of quality. I thought it lacked a lot of depth. MY opinion is that V for Vendetta was 40 times a better comic to film, and rightfully left the graphic novel pages to grace the screen, but this one should have been sent to DC to be published as print. Bottom line it would have made a decent reading comic, and I would probably like to see where it was going from the end, but it should have been scrapped for film, and they should have looked for something more iconic to better suit the hero that made it all possible.",1,3,emuns,"Jul 3, 2006",

8,A refreshingly sincere and exciting film,"MINOR SPOILERS One of SUPERMAN RETURNS best attributes (treating it's audiences like an adult) may also hurt it's box office potential. In a country where some of the worst reviewed films at the theaters (Da Vinci Code, X3) are also it's biggest hits, SUPERMAN RETURNS may have found greater box office triumph had if it instead treated it's audience like short attention span children. Without sensational controversy and taboo curiosity fueled hype or constant whiz bang pyrotechnics and one liners, SUPERMAN RETURNS with it's balance of reality, consequences, emotion and adventure is a throw back to the late 70's-early 80's, which ironically is an era when most film snobs complain not enough of the current crop of blockbusters take their inspiration from anymore. Now that a film that takes it's emotional core seriously has arrived, the complaint seems to be that the mega-budgeted film would have just been better off with more action, faster, rapid pace editing and calculated funny quip placements, dangled in front of a restless American audience like so many keys on Mom's key chain distracting her toddler child.Granted, SUPERMAN RETURNS could have indeed used a few of the lighter moments seen in the previews but not in the final product (Ben Hubbard is cut out almost completely), but it would be hard to imagine what should be cut in favor of those moments from the finished product. The film does have it's funny side, however, dominated mainly by scene steelers PARKER POSEY and SAM HUNTINGTON, not to mention bits by the superb Routh's Clark Kent and Sociopathic Lex Luthor played by Kevin Spacey. Spacey, while still very amusing and quick witted, is fairly removed from Gene Hackman's interpretation of the iconic baddie. Where Hackman was excellent as kind of a megalomaniac used car salesman, Spacey is charming, snide, but also downright sadistic. What's interesting is that Spacey's Lex also shows some genuine concern for his loyal side kick / girlfriend (although he is not above putting her life in danger if he arrogantly believes his planning is beyond any real ""risk"") and seems to know his henchmen so well, that volumes are spoken, or screamed by a distinct look or glance. His hatred for the Man of Steel also goes way beyond Saturday Matinée, mustache twirling revenge, but is a legitimate and calculated lust for vengeance; something he revels in with utter contempt when he gets his chance. When Lex and his crew finally get their hands on Krypton's Last Son, it is such a completely one-sided bit of brutalization that it hurts your heart a little to watch. This scene, more than almost any other in the nearly 2 and a half hour runtime stuck in my head days later. It is realistic and sad...for the moment.Other stand outs include the much talked about Airplane rescue scene (it is essential to see this scene AT the theaters!) and to a more noble and more human degree JAMES MARSDEN's Richard White. Ricahrd isn't some typical jerk third wheel, but in many ways Superman..without the Superpowers. This makes the dramatic tension all that more compelling. Kate Bosworth is wonderful as Lois, recalling a young Michelle Pfieffer. The most potentially fatal kryptonite of the flick, however, could have been (but thankfully is not) Tristan Lake LeBeau as the 4 year old Jason White. Young actors have a very hard time striking a balance between cute and legitimate. Too knowing and the kid is no longer a kid, but a little person imitating an adult actor. Too cute and you wince in pain. The little guy in Superman Returns, to put it simply, is perfect.Routh of course had the biggest hurdle in taking on the many faces of SUPERMAN/KAL-EL/CLARK KENT, but in recalling some of Christopher Reeves best qualities (distictive differences between the characters, a natural ability to take on a character who wants only to do good, and of course more than a passing resemblance to Reeve himself) along with some added depth to the part(s) emotional core(s) and humanity and you have a terrific addition to the legacy of actors who have tackled the part. I originally was very unhappy with the choice of Routh, now it's hard for me to imagine another actor today filling the red boots. Routh is the new Superman.One can only hope that the film has legs, and that in the coming weeks it hold up reasonably well. Pirates of The Caribben 2: (Electric Boogaloo) has been pitted against it in the media, which is unfortunate as PIRATES also looks to be an enjoyable Summer blockbuster. It seems the over emphasis of box office prognosticators has created an atmosphere where only one can be successful. SUPERMAN RETURNS, if it holds up well at the box office has more story to be told, and many possibilities left to explore and it would be sad if we were denied those story lines in favor of a more traditional fast and furious summer actioner in sequels to come. Superfeats and heroics are essential to the Man of Steel's story, but hopefully we will continue to be enlightened to his motivations and humanity as well. And despite whatever misgivings have been blared across blog boards and water coolers across the nation as to the film's big ""twist"", after watching the very moving moment with Superman and another pivotal character towards the end of the film, I have to say it's unfortunate if you keep a closed mind as you will miss a truly memorable and touching moment not just for this film, but for the entire franchise.Like the first X-MEN film, there is a lot of time spent on relationships, and while these moments are still very enjoyable, they lay an essential groundwork for future films in the franchise to come. And I for one look forward not only to seeing this movie again, but also the next chapters to be unveiled in the years ahead.",4,2,supercygnus,"Jul 4, 2006",

1,I fell asleep with my eyes open!!!,"Superman Returns looked great on the trailers but about 30 minutes into the movie I was so bored and the story line was so bad.. I felt like walking out of Superman Returns but I had a false hope that the movie would get better.... The only thing that got better were the corny one liners and stupid cameo lines which where copied from the first movie. What a cop out......So I had to watch this appalling movie to the end, just to see if it would get better. The only saving grace of the movie was the acting was O.K but everything else was lacking. I felt that there was no character development and at the end of the movie I felt like asking for a refund. Don't wast your time watching this lackbuster film. You would be better off watching grass growWhat a waste of 2 hours and 40 minutes of my life.... It will be the last time I watch a Superman movie........

9,Wow!  The best superhero movie ever made.,"I went into this movie expecting it to suck badly or contain a lot of cheese and corniness like so many other superhero movies. Like so many other movies in general. And to my surprise there were none. In a rare movie viewing moment this movie just blew me away. There wasn't a single point throughout this entire movie where I sunk in my seat ashamed & embarrassed to be watching this film. The pacing was great, I never got bored, there were no ""shake your head"" scenes, the acting was great, and the story was good. Kudos to Singer for not going over the top in trying to impress the audience like so many other directors do. Because it always fails. Always. I genuinely smiled and laughed and got choked up in this movie. My only problem with this movie is really just a nitpick. How was Superman able to lift a Kryptonite-laced continent into space? It should weakened him on the spot. But he did struggle with all his might to get it up there. I'm surprised this movie was so well done. I haven't been more happy to spend $20+ on a movie in so long. I can understand why a lot of people won't go see this movie. They don't like Superman because they think he's too powerful and they like some goofiness and campiness in these movies. Just look at Spider-Man's enormous box office success. Some people love that stuff. Not me. This is what superhero movies should be modeled after.",1,1,mikesmith-11,"Jul 4, 2006",

10,Superman Returns-a must see.,A must see for Superman fans. It was everything I wanted and more and I left the theater begging for more. The movie was 2 and a half hours and I could have easily sat waiting for another 2. Action scene junkies may be disappointed because the movie is not a non-stop roller coaster ride. There are action scenes that are incredible but there aren't a whole lot. If non-stop action is what someone wants to see then I suggest renting Die Hard or something like that. Brandon Routh played an excellent Superman/Clark Kent and I did not find myself comparing him with Christopher Reeve once. Which was fine by me. Watch the movie its fun.

5,Visuals Do Not Help Belabored Story,"Superman Movie: So-so. These days, there is no excuse for mediocre SFX. Superman delivers big time on SFX, but that would be a given, again, these days. However, SFX will never enhance a story that is not compelling (think the last few StarWars outings). This reviewer, for one, feels that the director's methods and the script/screen play writer's pen undermined the overall impact of the film, as glorious as the effects are in general. The story is long and slow (so many belabored reaction shots), and suspending disbelief is stretched to the limit. Interestingly, there was no audience buzz after the show either. The house was fairly full (first weekend and all), but people did not seem too excited when exiting. This viewer calls this film a ""leg mover"" - a film that you try to watch to the end, but you have to keep changing body positions to stay involved. 5 stars out of 10.",0,0,Vansud,"Jul 4, 2006",

I thought it was great because the special effects were good and the story didn't bore me like most super hero movies do. There were some things I didn't like (which I didn't realize until later after I watched the old superman movies) like how most of the funny lines were taken from the original superman. I think that by re-making superman they should have veered away from those movies and tried to make superman more original, like batman begins did. For the most part I thought it was a great movie.",1,1,idancetherobot22,"Jul 4, 2006",
7,Animal Lovers Beware!,Did I like the movie overall yes however were I to know that an animal would have been killed or harmed in the movie I would not have gone to see it. I was shocked and appalled that they would do this in a movie that children would go to see. I do not think in any way it added to the movie and it certainly think that it detered from the movie. and then at the end there is more hinting that there will be further harm to an animal. Again this is totally unnecessary and only served to detract from the movie. I have been to adult R rated violent movies that didn't do this so why pray tell is this done in a movie that children would go to see. As far as I'm concerned unless its a horror movie there are two taboos in movies that they should keep away from and that is harm to children or to animals. Its one thing when an animal is thought to possibly be harmed and then is not but this was not the case here at all. I had to cover my eyes during part of the movie because of it. I have warned others on websites I belong to and will not be seeing any sequel unless I know that someone else has seen it first and tells me that no animals were harmed in the movie. Warner Bros. should be ashamed to put children through this. I would have been deeply traumatized had I seen this as a child.,0,1,MonkeesRI,"Jul 4, 2006",
9,Give it a minute to sink in,"First off don't take advice on whether or not to see this movie from someone who didn't like the original film, doesn't know how to spell kal-el, and/or thinks Smallville is the only good representation of the superman story. Don't get me wrong I like smallville. I watch it all season because the writers will give me at least 3 very good episodes...but thats out of an entire season. That leaves a lot of crappy episodes too. That being said Tom Welling is great and Michael Rosenbaum is the best Lex I've ever seen. On to this movie... The casting is genius. Brandon Routh is amazing...not only does he capture the role of Superman perfectly. He recaptures the Clark that Christopher Reeves showed us. Its almost uncanny you'll see what I mean. The story line is where everyone gets hung up, but you just have to give it a chance. You have to look at it this way. Singer had the choice of whether or not to show us the same story we've all seen before or to come with something totally new. And thats what He did he brought us a story we haven't seen before we don't automatically know how this will end or even where he is going with it in the next film. But thats good. With Hollywood overrun with remakes and regurgitated story lines its exciting to NOT know where this is going. Another complaint you might hear is the pace. ""Its not as action packed as spiderman 2 or x-men 2 it didn't live up to potential"". For this answer you have to remember X-men 1. Singer likes to build a base storyline to work with. X-men 1 was not near as action packed as the 2nd one. But he built the characters. I feel like thats what he did in this film. He works a little character development in. It does slow up the pace and make the movie a little long. But I think overall the next film will benefit from it. So I would definitely recommend seeing this film...maybe not the latest showing. But its the first must see of the summer. I'm ready to see it again already",344,302,joshuabrandon,"Jul 4, 2006",

10,Visually stunning,"Other than ""wow"", I'm not sure where to begin putting into words my experience seeing Superman Returns. I will admit my lifelong Superman-worship biased me going into this. In some ways that makes me a prime target for this film, but also a member of the demographic that could be more difficult to please. All I can say is that I don't know if there is such a thing as a ""perfect"" comic-book film, but for me this one gets just about as close to such as possible - doing so with a stylistically different take than almost any ""comic"" film that's come before.The visuals throughout the film are breathtaking and - literally, for me - jaw-dropping. More than a handful of moments/scenes had me riveted and almost giddy with glee over seeing things play out on screen that I had only imagined from my years of pouring over comic book panels.ALL of the ""what-if""s I've imagined over the years, regarding the potential for showcasing Superman's abilities using modern film-making technologies were supremely addressed and perfectly played out in so many instances. The flight is stunning. Not just the ""up and away"" moments or the cruising into space scenes, but the smaller visuals - the hovering up and down, the levitation without pretense - it all just flows seamlessly, making me feel and truly believing Clark could do everything I was seeing. The impact is astounding.A pleasant bonus on the powers/abilities angle is how their uses/needs are written into the action - not just there for just the spectacle/grandeur (though they do have that effect) in the sense of ""he can FLY; he shoots HEAT from his eyes; he has super BREATH; he's FAST - look how cool it all is!"" No - the abilities are shown practically, as tools in this hero's arsenal to be a protector and force for good, and hits home the idea that there is NO ONE ELSE who could do what he does - especially for the selfless, greater-good mentality he exhibits. Without being specific, some of the heat-vision scenes are just plain awesome. And the showcase of his strength is climaxed toward the last half-hour in a god-like feat that just gave me chills. Just another stunning, indelible visual in a film that is so beautifully shot, with such reverence for the icons, that it literally made me misty.What I noticed this film does well as a contrast to recent ""event"" hero films is in allowing the action sequences time to get established, with longer shots and less frequent cuts. Other reviewers have described it as giving the developments room to ""breathe"", and I agree. There is less of a frenetic pacing to the 'wham-bam' moments that keep your adrenaline up, which in turn gives the scope of what unfolds more of an epic/grand feeling. We get a little more time to appreciate the ""heroics"", which lends a little more realism and situational gravitas to the feats we see happening, and I think the older fans who appreciate the weight of the history behind Superman as a character will value this style more.And for all the greatness in the action moments we get, the literal 'heart' of the story lies in the emotional toll found in Clark's/Superman's alienation - pun not intended. Singer and his screenwriters manage to infuse a powerful sense of loneliness in Clark that has seldom been touched upon as effectively, without saccharine camp. And the feeling evoked isn't overly angst-filled or tortured, like those associated with Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, because that isn't who Superman is. It gives a feeling of sadness in the (audience's) realization that Clark is a pretty solitary figure - the last of his civilization, apparently not too missed by those from his former personal life and the world as a whole. He returns to find that these emotional ties/foundations have shifted while he was away, and the world has maintained its way without him.Of course, the fact that his reappearance to the world occurs in just the nick of time (literally) is a slick way to start the emotional shift that Clark will find himself facing by the story's end. His necessity to the world in general is once again demonstrated, and there are huge developments that fundamentally change the course of his existence as a Kryptonian on Earth. There is a big reveal about two-thirds of the way through that answers the biggest plot/character question posed from the onset, and is something that has never been done in any form of Superman canon before. It's an intriguing turn to the mythos, for sure, and there will no doubt be much debate over the relative positives and negatives this may have on the franchise in general. For me, it is handled well, and sets up one of the final scenes that emotionally sucker-punched me (in a good way). If the film's outcast/alienation theme has had any resonance with the viewer at all by this point, then this scene will pack a wallop. It did for me.There's not enough room here to get into the quality of the casting - of which I had some initial questions, but was quickly satisfied thoroughly. Everyone brings these characters to life, and makes the roles their own.IMO, if you enjoyed the original film, you'll appreciate this one. There are still laugh-out-loud moments that will keep a smile on your face while you prepare for the next heart-thumping crescendo of action. And there are more than a few visual moments that directly reference classic comic images over the last 68 years - most notably, the cover of Action Comics #1. Small details like that give me a profound respect for where Singer's vision has taken us into a re-launch of the franchise, and it makes me more than pleased that my hero's film-future seems to be in more than capable hands.",232,230,clarkkent179,"Jul 4, 2006",

It was a really action packed movie too. And I kinda wanted her to end up with superman but it was still good how it ended. And i liked it how, her son Jason was the son of superman and at the one part he saved his mom. Also it was funny how clark was sometimes kinda of a dork not that he is but when they were like talking and they looked over and then he like smiles and waves.

10,A New Legend,"With the tradition of Star Wars and other moves that write before and after moves of already classics, this one is no exception. Because the cast is entirely new there are things they have to work on with character development. Spacey as Lex Luthor was sensational, a perfect choice to follow in Gene Hackman's on screen development. Spacey even had the sick sense of humor and snide jokes like in the originals. There are some things that are questionable from plot perspective, as you will see when viewing this movie. The movie as a whole was sensational. I was so impressed that you could not tell if it was CGI or the real deal. There are scenes in the movie that will take your breath away. I do wish we could have seen more character development on Brandon Routh's part. Granted we all know what type of person Superman/Clark Kent is and should be, but hopefully in the next movie there will be more added to Brandon's dialogue. Yet the looks from Superman were worth more than words. Facts held true for the entire movie. The only thing I did not like in the movie was Lois Lane's boyfriend played by James Marsden. It was odd to see two ""super heroes"" in one movie. Because he's already Cyclops in X-Men I think they should have given the role to someone else. However, he did play a good Richard White. I would love to say more, but because this movie has many plot twists I do not want to ruin it for everyone else. I think Christopher Reeve would have been pleased. The thing people forget that it wasn't just Reeve that made the movie, it was the icon that did. ""Returns"" will grace our new generation of children with the hope that they will follow the lead of Superman and fight for ""Truth, Justice and the American Way"".",4,4,dolphin552000,"Jul 4, 2006",

10,Remarkable Must see this film!,"""well welcome back superman and a amazing return you've brought back with you. Without a question the best film of 2006 by far. With outstanding preformaces and effects this is an amazing film. Brandon Routh plays an fantastic Clark Kent/superman (hate to say this) even better than Chris Reeve. He brought back the nerd we all know and the hero we all want to be. And Kate Bosworth before the film she seemed like a goodie good to me not a Lois. But she threw in the reporter, rebel, smoking but good hearted person all together with a little bit of loving mom and wow great preformace. Then Kevin Spacey paid his tribute to Gene Hackman and also threw in his own great personality we all know. The rest of the cast gave the film drama,action and laughter all to the screen for one thrilling ride! Now truth be told i always found the superman costume tacky and old but with Brian Singers beautiful lighting effects the costume always appeared amazing and royal.After seeing ""Catwomen"",""Hulk"",Fantasic Four"", and the last couple Superman's i thought a ""good"" superhero movie was never going to come but Brian Singer made my dream come true with returning the hero.with the right music, cast, director, and amazing screenplay which brought everything the perfect movie needs Superman Returns is by far the best superhero movie I've ever seen and the best film of 2006!

8,Made me recall a famous Audrey Hepburn line,"I've never actually seen the movie 'Charade' with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, but it contains an exchange that most people will find familiar. Audrey Hepburn asks Cary Grant, 'You know what's wrong with you.' He has proved during the course of the movie he can't be trusted, is a liar among many other things. 'What?' is his reply. She finishes the movie with, 'Absolutely nothing.' Why does she say that, because it's Cary Grant. That is probably the best way to describe Superman Returns. There are a lot of things that you can nitpick everywhere, a scene, a line, a moment of complete physical impossibility. Take a center-piece scene where a Boeing 747 is out of control, falling fast from a high altitude, spinning horizontally, barrel rolls, both wings rip off and its passengers are getting knocked around like marbles in a bag. Superman rushes to the rescue and catches the plane just before certain disaster. Checking up on the passengers they all appear shaken but unhurt. From the sheer g-forces alone they should all be dead, but that is besides the point of this movie, which is Superman catches a 747! It's the real Superman. This movie is intended to be a continuation of the first two Superman movies, some of the best movies of all time, let alone comic book movies. The opening credits and the closing scene is done the same way, but with a modern pizazz. In comparison, despite how good the Spiderman and the X-Men movies have been, they have not come close to such a grand, epic scale that this movie embodies. Here, Superman catches the 747, out-flies a gas explosion, and includes a finale that only Superman could do. The story is that Superman left Earth for five years to find Krypton and figure out if he is truly alone. Returning after a depressing search, he learns that people have just gone on without him, especially Lois Lane. Lois is engaged to a decent man, Richard White, and has a young boy as well. Returning as Clark Kent as well, he tries to renew a friendship with Lois and re-establish himself at the Daily Planet. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has gotten out of jail on a technicality and started a new plan. Stealing crystals from Supermans now dormant Fortress of Solitude, he plans on using the alien technology to create a new continent. When Superman returns to the public eye, he gets ready to keep him out of the way. The performances are good all around, and everyone gets a respectable amount of time to grow. Brandon Routh will forever be compared to Christopher Reeve, but he does a good job with a slight re-visioning of the two characters played. Superman is confident but more emotionally vulnerable and Clark Kent is mild-mannered but less awkward. Kate Bosworth makes a great performance as Lois who is glad to see Superman again, but out of principle is trying to stop herself from falling in love with him again. The only problem is that Clark and Lois don't get much time to interact alone, all their scenes are as Lois and Superman. James Marsden steps as Cyclops to get some screen time as Richard. He gets so much time that he goes beyond just the 'Romantic Rival' to being an important part of the story. And like I said before, he is a decent guy, making everything more complicated. Sam Huntington plays Jimmy Olsen with a lot of fun, youthful energy, and Frank Langella has Perry White be dedicated and hard-nosed about his newspaper without mimicking the fast-talking cigar smoker of Jackie Coopers Perry White or J. Jonah Jameson from Spiderman. Kevin Spacey has fun with Lex Luthor, which is much in the same vein as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor. But this time Lex manages to keep a balance between comical and being a true foe of Superman. The things that make you laugh are placed completely in context with his sadistic behavior, and with the stolen technology, he is an actual threat. If there is anything serious to complain about, it is that Lex Luthors jeopardy plot is sinister enough, but what hurts the story is what Lex plans on doing with the land. He mentions beach front property and having all this technology to defy the world, but it seems like all he has is the ability to grow land. The danger is still real, but it deflates the plot. But the real joy of the movie is seeing Superman do what he does best. He rescues people, flies, and does all those things we love to see him do. And he is the first, and greatest superhero.",3,2,KJMackley,"Jul 4, 2006",

The movie picks up right where Superman left off and the characters were easy to get involved with. Brandon Routh was an excellent choice for the role of Superman! I saw it initially at Cinemark & I cannot wait to go see the movie now at the Imax in 3D. It was about 2.5 hours long and I could have easily watched for a bit longer to allow for a bit more character development for Lex Luther and his ""evil plan"". That is the only part of the movie that I think could have been a little more involved. His part in the story felt rushed, while Lois and Superman's love story seemed to carry more weight. All in all, great movie.",1,1,liveart8,"Jul 4, 2006",

10,Wow,"I just saw Superman Returns and was completely blown away. I had read a review a couple of days ago that said that even though the movie is two and a half hours long you won't feel the need to look at your watch. Conscious of this I almost wanted to look at my watch right away but less than ten minutes in I forgot I even had a watch and the next thing I new the movie was over. From the opening credits, which are done almost exactly like the original movie from '78 you are instantly removed from reality. Using the original music was one of the smartest things they could have done, it's far too iconic to have a Superman movie without it. The actors are of course new but have no problems living up to and in some cases surpassing the original's cast. There is tons of action packed into this movie and when there's not action there's comic relief and although I typically don't like the romantic turns that most hero stories take (just cause I'm a guy and they're a little boring) I had no problem with that stuff either, the imagery that comes along with it makes it well worth while.I've been babbling kinda randomly so I'll just talk straight for a second. The movie has a great story, a perfect way of reviving a hero that everyone has grown up with without retelling or bastardizing it. The action is well paced and choreographed, the original will always be great, for nostalgia if nothing else, but the moments of intense peril in this movie blow all those previous incarnations out of the water. The special effects are not only great but they're natural and keep the viewer somewhere in between a surreal comic book reality and the real life city you work and live in. They also add a texture to the movie that make even the slow moments (of which there are few) interesting to look at. The humor is subtle and effective, some very funny moments without treading into campy territory. The love story is strong and effective but kept at just the right level, enough to make you care about their relationship without getting boring and sappy or mushy. The acting is great on every level.SEE THIS MOVIE!",154,148,on_the_can,"Jul 4, 2006",
5,"Good acting, but still a poor movie","The movie is very boring. I feel maybe only young boys and girls feel it is interesting. Many scenes in the movie are repetitive and redundant. The plot and some scenes are so predictable, which makes you feel nothing to see or expect. No challenge, no excitement. My friend who went to the theater even had a nap there.I do not know why the critics give it an A-. It seems that they are not critical enough this time as they are to other movies.However, I would say the actings are very good. The actors and actresses make the characters in the movie very convincing and real. It makes me feel they are absorbed into the character and become the real person inside. Brandon Routh is very convincing as a superman.",0,1,uclaxlhuang,"Jul 4, 2006",

9,Outstanding!,"What an outstanding piece of film-making! Bryan Singer has done a terrific job on this film. I was awestruck right from the opening credits (what an amazing sequence). This film has a lot of action without being Armaggedon-ridiculous: it's gripping and exciting but not overdone, and it does indeed manage to stay exciting right up until the end. I was soundly entertained throughout the whole picture.But it's not only the action that keeps this film going: Kevin Spacey was absolute perfection as Lex Luthor. He blew Gene Hackman right out of the water, he's creepy yet brilliant, delivering his lines with wit and smarm and absolute contempt for humanity. Perfect for one of the most iconic villains in all ""comicdom"".I also liked Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Kate plays Lois Lane as Lois Lane should be played: intelligent, driven, committed, yet human. I always felt the old DC comics failed in properly portraying Lois, and subsequent films & TV shows carried the misbegotten concept of ditzy reporter too far. Pulitzer-prize winning reporters are anything BUT dingbats, Kate (and Bryan) finally did the character in a way that I felt it should be done.The only thing that this film lacked is humanity on the part of Superman himself. Yes, Brandon Routh emotes in this film, showing the pain the Man of Steel feels at how things have turned out. But you never really get into his head. The film is really about Lois and Lex, not about Superman at all, and that's a shame and a flaw in the script.If they had worked more at the inclusion of Clark/Superman as a real character, and not as just an action hero, this film would have deserved a 10. As it is, I gave it a 9: that flaw was almost entirely compensated by the terrific action sequences and visuals.Barky",1,1,Barky44,"Jul 4, 2006",
9,Almost Swayed,"I admit a horrible truth. A truth that is taking a lot for me to admit. I almost was swayed by all the narrow minded nay-sayers from seeing this movie. Alas, my love for the ""man"" and my desire to re-visit my childhood dreams of being the ""man"" won. And thank God( or whoever you believe in) for that change of heart. I almost missed was is arguably one of the best comic book movies of all time. And a damn good movie in it'sown right. It did what most other movies taken from a book and/or other media came close to doing a few times. #1 Show respect to the fans, #2 Show respect to the new comers and last but most important #3 It showed respect to those that came before. Yes there were inaccuracies; anyone that can see any movie and never hear or find one please let me know I have a golden egg for ya!!! And yes there were questions, some involving the beginning sequence and some concerning a character introduced here that was not in the 3rd of 4th movie. But all in all it did A lot for the series, a lot for the medium and a lot for the box office. It caught you up and explained things just enough without putting the faithful asleep. It pulled you in making the emotional story and interactions at the forefront. Yet still having the action and C.G.I. to keep the adrenaline junkies awake. I must close with a statement. Some have said Superman is too powerful and unbelievable. I say it was never about being too powerful, it was the heart behind it. The conscience, the love, the respect, the value of life and finally the brains he used in using his powers. These are the things we wanted most. Not to fly, but to be the people we could be as he was and never tried hard enough. Thank you Bryan Singer and all involved for making this 30-year old a boy again, for showing respect to Mr. Reeve and passing the torch. If the comic movies are coming to an end, we went out with a bang. Thank you for reading my venting.",0,0,neo7383,"Jul 4, 2006",
3,crap. casting director should be fired.,"The special effects were top notch, but I think the acting was crap. Nothing really stood out for me.Zombie Christopher Reeves would have done a better superman.. this new guy was terrible.. he tried to mimic Reeves, but failed and is nothing more than a pretty boy actor who probably only has a future in soft-core porn.As for Bosworth, yes she is a beautiful actress, but don't forget that she was in blue crush... a terrible choice for Lois.What is it with comic book movies going on wild tangents? I give the film a 3/10, but I have to give Kevin Spacey a 9/10.. he was the only enjoyable character of the movie, for me at least. His girlfriend (Kitty was it?) annoyed the crap out of me, but I do not want to spoil as to why.One thing you must realize is that I compare all these comic book movies to the Spiderman films (I would compare them to Sin City, but that just wouldn't be fair ;0) ). In my humble opinion, the Spiderman movies have been excellent thus far. The casting and acting have been impressive (let's not forget the effects adding to the equation). Superman Returns lacked the connection that was there with the older films.See the film if you do not care about wasting $8, otherwise, wait until your friend rents/buys the DVD.I would have definitely made some improvements to the cast, script, direction, but no one listens to the no-name critic.",0,1,pwoznic,"Jul 4, 2006",
9,Loved This Movie!!!!!,"When I first saw the previews for this movie my initial thoughts were, ""Well, it looks like they're going to ruin another classic."" I couldn't imagine a sequel to the earlier renditions that could possibly do justice to the precedent set forth by Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Margot Kidder. Superman Returns came within a hair's inch of doing just that. The opening action sequence was worth the cost of admission and really made the action sequences from the earlier movies pretty mundane.Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey were a stronger ensemble than Gene Hackman and Ned Beatty hands down as the villainous Lex Luthor and his accomplice. The visual effects and cinematography were excellent and the story line was very well done - I won't address the story because I wouldn't want to spoil it.The ""hair's inch"" where this movie fell short was Lois Lane. Don't get me wrong, Kate Bosworth is amazing to look at on the screen. That's the problem. Margot Kidder's Lois Lane was beautiful but had a real ""working girl"" quality about her that is lost in Bosworth. She's just a little too glamorous to pull off a hard-nosed/won't take no for an answer investigative reporter. Additionally, this woman could get the crap kicked out of her over and over again and yet never show any kind of a mark from it.All things considered, I'd pay to see this movie again and again. A great film.",0,0,clorear,"Jul 4, 2006",
6,"Not terrible, but certainly forgettable","Fairly entertaining, but entirely unmemorable. Superman returns from exploring the wastes of his home planet, Krypton, to learn that Lois has a kid and a live-in boyfriend. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor has been released from prison and has invaded the Fortress of Solitude in order to steal Kryptonian technology. The plot from there more or less writes itself. Too bad it also doesn't edit itself, as the film lasts over two and a half hours. The cast is mostly generic. Brandon Routh seems weak, but that's probably not his fault. The screenwriters have written little for him to do. Kate Bosworth is pretty but doesn't strike me as the Lois Lane type. Only Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor gives anything close to a good performance. He pales in comparison to Gene Hackman, but he has some very good moments. I absolutely hate that little moppet who plays Lois' kid. He's in desperate need of a haircut. The action sequences are mostly enjoyable, although they cross far into the territory of ridiculous. I read an article shortly before the release of the film that said the film pays closer attention to science than previous Superman movies. Perhaps – the climactic sequence of the '78 Superman is one of the most ludicrous moments in cinema history. But the first action sequence, in which Superman saves a doomed plane and no one, given real world physics, would have survived, is nearly as bad.",1,3,zetes,"Jul 4, 2006",
10,Best Superman Movie Ever!,"This is the best Superman movie ever!Going in I was skeptical that anyone would ever match Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder as Lois & Clark. Now Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth have raised the bar. They didn't just play the roles; they defined the characters all over again, creating a new gold standard.For me, the most pleasant surprise was Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor. In 1978 Gene Hackman played Lex as an idiot. Spacey's Lex is a ""criminal mastermind"" truly worthy to oppose Superman. Spacey is 1,000 times better than Hackman any day.Yes, many of the other characters were weak. But who cares? It was the Clark/Superman, Lois Lane, and Lex Luthor show, and those three were fantastic!OK, I'm not quite ready to take down my Margot Kidder poster, but I'm making room for Kate Bosworth beside her!",0,1,jzc-3,"Jul 4, 2006",

It is witty and truly heartfelt. It's a good time at the movies with a bucket of popcorn. The characters are well written for and the performances were excellent. Kevin Spacey pulled off a wonderful performance as Lex Luthor, embracing the maniac within. Brandon Routh makes a wonderful showing as Superman and embraces both Superman and Clark Kent (and for the teenage hormonal girls in the audience, he is a wonderful bit of eye candy to make watching this with your little brother truly enjoyable).I wholeheartedly nominate this movie for a trip to me theatres to escape the summer heat.",0,0,meredith-kenton,"Jul 4, 2006",

So, with the afternoon off from work, and a latté in hand, I was ready to welcome back 'the man of steel'. A quarter of the way through, despite the action and special effects, I was unmoved. Determined to have fun, I lowered my expectations. But half way through, my mind started to continually wondered off (""hmmm, I wonder if they still use canola oil for popcorn? hey, I wonder if shut off the coffee-maker?""). Three quarters of the way through, I started to check my watch every few minutes. This wasn't what I signed up for. There I sat in the dark theater eagerly anticipating a return to childhood wonderment, and instead this curiously unengaging film almost became my Ambien. In the days since I saw this movie, I wondered about my reaction to the movie. I mean, all the ingredients were there: good storyline, snappy dialog, plenty of action sequences, great special effects. And yet, there I sat, yawning. Then, it hit me (actually, my wife noticed it): Superman, remember he's the main character, had very little dialog, and expressed little emotion throughout the movie. Most of the snappy dialog was everybody else's but his. This is a major flaw. How did I miss it?! It's hard to care about the movie, if the movie's main character is un-engaging, or downright boring. That's what it boiled down to for me. Superman was boring, therefore the movie was boring. Period.

10,Ignore the Haters - This Movie Rules,"There are all sorts of different reasons the haters are trashing this movie. A lot of them decided they were going to diss this movie even before they saw it. Funny they still rushed to the theatre to see it anyway. One reason they are being particularly vicious may have to do with the fact it had a significantly bigger opening weekend than the craptacular ""Batman Begins"". Well the only reason that movie was praised was because the horrid wretched stink of ""Batman and Robin"" was still fresh in everyone's psyche. Any new rethink of the Batman character after that atrocity was bound to do well and had people overlooking its many flaws the prebuscent looking completely miscast Katie Holmes for example. Now mind you the amount of time between when ""Batman and Robin"" came out and ""Batman Begins"" was only 8 years. The last time there was a Superman movie was 20 years ago! Another reason for all the negativity has to do with this trend of comparing this movie too closely to the 1978 original Superman. Let's not forget that movie started it all and set the bar for all super hero movies that followed. There was no way Bryan Singer would or could ignore that fact so he carefully remained faithful to what was created and started almost 30 years ago. The last and most obvious reason is homophobia and anti-semitism. Singer has been open about both his Jewish heritage as well as homosexuality and it was hard enough for a lot of prejudice haters to deal with the success he had with X-Men, but when he got to direct ""Superman"", that was just too much for them to swallow. They were determined to bash Singer and this movie no matter how good it really was. The bottom line is this movie should not and cannot compared to the original 1978 Superman even though it pays homage to it. At the same time this movie is far better than ""Batman Begins"" and ""Spider-man 2"" combined, but the haters won't admit it. They want you to think otherwise. This movie has many brilliantly executed action sequences, the right amount of comic relief while still having an edge, and a competent cast of actors including Routh who while isn't on the same level of Christopher Reeve, still does a fine job of playing The Man of Steel. All in all a fun and action packed and must see movie of the summer and especially if you can catch in IMax 3D.",0,0,dreamxone,"Jul 4, 2006",

10,The Best One Since the First Superman,"The only downfall to this movie is that it does not delve as deeply as a true Superman fan would like into the human relationships inherent in the Superman series. Superman/Clark barely exchanges with Jimmy or Perry White or even Lex for that matter. But I think there will be more of that in later movies. Other than that the movie is excellent. I love the classics, but the development of CGI allows the filmmaker to do so much more with Superman. And in case anyone didn't notice, it's wide open for sequels, which is great. For anyone complaining about the filmmaker not giving enough background information... IT'S SUPERMAN! For pete's sake... everyone knows the story of Superman. If you're not familiar enough for this movie to satisfy your craving for a quality Superman installment, then you shouldn't be watching it in the first place. Oh, and for the clown complaining about it not being fresh and original like Batman Begins... compare the titles RETURNS/BEGINS then look up the meanings. By the title, the director never promised a fresh start, it was a continuation. And because there will be sequels, there will be fresh starts and new angles. Long story short, the Batman series had been played out since the second movie and it needed a whole new start, but Superman did not. The world only needed to be reaquainted and the best way to do that is to simply continue on as the title suggests. And get off Bryan Singer's back, he's an action director. AAAAARGH. Pull your heads out of your asses. The audience responded extremely well at the viewing i attended, better than I've seen in a long time. This was a good movie, damn the critics.

7,Superman Returns,"Just returned from seeing ""Superman Returns"". I thought the casting was overall quite good. Of course, Kevin Spacey is a winner in almost every role. Brandon Routh should be cast in ""The Christopher Reed Story"" if it is ever filmed. He portrayed ""The Man of Steel"" uncannily like Mr. Reed. I gave this film a seven (7) because its weakest point is the plot. The story just never really grabs you and make you wait breathlessly for the next bit to unfold. The special effects were top notch, and the musical score was thrilling and entertaining throughout, but my companion at the film said he was bored the last hour and a half because the story just never went anywhere. Am I alone with this criticism? Maybe a bit of fine-tuning by the director and the editor might have brought a more compelling conclusion to the film. I will wait till it comes out with a ""Director's Cut"" DVD to see it again. Maybe the commentary will include what motivated the director to go the way he did. I have the feeling they were leaving the way clear for a sequel if this movie was successful at the box office. I loved the detail work and effort for realism that was maintained, and only wish the writer had worked out his story a little more. Spacey must have loved portraying Lex Luthor! Following in the hallowed footsteps of Gene Hackman's portrayal, I believe he did a first rate job. I would certainly encourage the recasting of Mr. Spacey and Mr. Routh in any future films carrying on the ""Superman"" dynasty.",0,0,lilcindykins,"Jul 5, 2006",

And he makes an even better Superman. Routh brings depth to both characters and you can read his emotions on his face. He has the most beautiful face I've seen on screen.I think this movie is everything a comic book flick should be. It's got action, humor, feelings, a love triangle, and inside stuff to warm my geek heart. I love that there are cameos by two stars from the 1950's TV series, Superman. I love the inside jokes and quotes from Superman lore. I love the new Superman outfit. I should point out that I'm female and I've seen the film four times already.I felt that Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor was probably the most evil film villain I've seen yet. What he did was just so unthinkably awful, I felt sorry for poor Superman having to clean all the mess up. Luthor's henchmen were all great, and Parker Posey as Kitty was a hoot and a half.Kate Bosworth is an okay Lois Lane. Lois Lane has never been one of my favorite characters anyway. I hate how she loves Superman and not Clark Kent. My allegiance has always been to CK (although don't get me wrong, I'd take Supes in a heartbeat as well). I just like the man behind the tights, that's all. But Bosworth is a tad young for this role – she's only 23 and has a five-year-old child. I don't know how old the Lois character is supposed to be, but Bosworth does look her age so it doesn't help matters. However, she is a good actress and does a decent enough job. I just don't get how she can be tossed around so much in the movie and not have one single bruise (oh yeah, it's a comic movie).I didn't have a problem with Jimmy Olson or Perry White – they just were kind of bland to me. I felt the other hero of the film is James Marsden's Richard White. He was excellent in the movie and deserves credit for its success. I wish I had things so bad to be torn between two such hot, upstanding men. Do they exist in real life, I mean really?? Sure, some of the stuff could've been cut from the film to tighten it up a bit, but overall it's a great film in my opinion. I think the opening credits are worth the price of admission. I felt 15 again, as if I were watching Superman The Movie (which I saw in January 1979)! I can't wait for the DVD with all the extras and I hope deleted scenes. My one and only gripe about the film is why does Clark/Superman's eye color keep changing from blue to brown? It makes no sense why in some scenes Supes has blue eyes, and in another scene they are brown. Is this done on purpose and, if so, why? But hey if that's the biggest problem I can find with the film, I'm sure the filmmakers are happy.",0,0,sstones63,"Jul 5, 2006",
9,Very good considering it isn't reeve,"As with the first person to comment on this film i too went with some bias in mind. however i enjoyed all the previous superman films, no they weren't exactly the best acted but they were all enjoyable and fun.I watched this film whilst on holiday in Florida a few days ago and i really enjoyed it. I felt the likeness between Reeve and Routh was frightening!! And the first 10 minutes of the film my jaw was on the floor.I don't want to ruin the film for anyone reading this so i wont write too much but i will say that everyone should go and watch this, young and old. There is a big twist but it is quite obvious early on (well to me it was anyway) but don't let this put you off as the acting is good enough to be a blockbuster and no it doesn't warrant an Oscar for the acting but its a lot better than a lot of other films out at the moment.Go and watch it.",0,0,marc-649,"Jul 5, 2006",
4,"Frankly, just plain boring","Anyone assuming that you'll be seeing a restart of the Superman series on par with the excellent ""Batman Begins"" movie will be sorely disappointed. Be prepared for a rather large lack of back story, character development, or likable characters.Only until after watching the movie did someone explain that this film is allegedly set chronologically somewhere between Superman 2 and 3 or after Superman 3 and to ignore Superman 4, 5, Smallville, Lois and Clark, and most of the comic book series. How are we supposed to know this? Um, dumb luck, word of mouth, fan sites... The director certainly didn't help you there.Lex Luthor is portrayed as just evil. He was funny/evil in previous movies, but here, he's just bad. Lois still can't spell to save her life, but emotions aren't in her acting vocabulary. Jimmy's barely on the screen. The Christopher Reeves stand-in they got is dead on for looks and on par with Mr. Reeves's current acting ability. This is most likely to the most dull of scripts designed for Superman so far.Sure, you've got your Technicolor Spandex adventures, but while trying not to nod off, all I could think is that Batman could totally whup this ""super man"" in a fight, and he's supposed to be the greatest of the great.

10,Superman Returns as Box Office Hit!~,"I haven't looked forward to many movies for the past few years. Even Superman Returns seemed to be a movie too huge for anyone to make and satisfy hardcore fans and be appealing to those who do not know Superman's stories. But Superman Returns did just that. It delivered in staying true to the classic image of Superman, while portraying Superman in a today's modern world. The movie captured a blend of Superman's stories and still easily told the tale to anyone who didn't know Superman's stories. Superman Returns truly brought back a classic American icon into the mainstream. ""Superman Returns,"" I'd say is a rival for all blockbuster movies such as the Spiderman and the amazing Star Wars series. Of course, Superman Returns needs high praised sequels to actually be considered a great movie series, but if Superman's next movies get higher and higher ratings, Superman will become even greater than just being SUPER!~",1,0,Shermstyle23,"Jul 5, 2006",
1,Could have been better,"When I heard that there was going to be a new Superman Movie, I was not sure what to think if it was going to be good. But with Batman Begins, I said that maybe a it could work in the new era, with the technology that we have today, than over 27 years ago with first Superman movie this could work. After viewing the movie, I came to realize that you need more that computer special effects to help you. THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE. If was not entertaining, you could get more excitement from watching Superman on Jutice League or Smallville. In the first hour and thirty minutes all he did was stop a plane from crashing. The rest of the time he is try to get back in good with Ms. Lois Lane who, moved on the new man in her life. After that is them trying to profess their love but could not do it. The movie should have been called Forbidding Love... The Superman, Lois Lane Story. The director and screenwriter where try to make another Siderman movie , when in my opinion they should have tried the Batman Begins type plot. If you are looking for a love movie with your boyfriend or girlfriend this is the one to see. I hope that they don't make a sequel and that superman having a KID with Lois Lane bad idea. If you are a true Superman fan you will agree with me with how bad this movie was from script to the lack of action sequences. I should have went and see the DEVIL WEARS PARDA, it looks more manly movie to me.",2,3,carpediem1678-1,"Jul 5, 2006",
7,Very good non-epic can't hit it out of the park,"Finally a new Superman movie appears in ""Superman Returns,"" and while it is a good film, what it really does the most is remind everyone just how incredible ""Superman The Movie"" is, and how perfect Chris Reeve is at playing Superman.Superman comes back after five years (ignoring Superman 3 and 4) and starts his do-gooding all over again, while striving to make up with lois Lane, who he ditched without saying goodbye. The five-years thing is kind of easy to buy, even though the movie shows the piece of Kryptonite (from Adas Abbaba or however it is spelled) that came to Earth in 1978, and actually pointing out it came in 1978, in one of the many nods to the first film.Superman starts off again in the now famous plane-saving sequence - but I'm wondering, am I the only one that was underwhelmed at this scene? From what i've read and heard about it, I almost expected the most amazing scene ever put on film - but instead, it was just a typical CGI-cartoon scene of a cartoon Superman saving a cartoon plane. The scene on the ground after the plane was settled down on the ballfield was actually much better.But that kind of tells the story of the movie - Superman cries for an ""epic"" but ""Superman Returns"" just isn't an epic. The special effects are really just typical CGI cartoons and nothing special, really the FX in ""Superman"" from 1978, made almost 30 years earlier, are much better and much more realistic.The most fun about Superman Returns is spotting all the nods to ""Superman The Movie,"" my favorites being Clark saying ""swell"" and the title sequence at the film's start. There are many little things scattered in the picture that maybe only real diehards would know.The acting - Brandon Routh was good, but it shows how hard it must have been to find someone to play Superman/Clark. He is OK, but not great. Not bad, he gets it done, but he doesn't light up the screen. He essentially is playing Chris Reeve as Superman and Chris Reeve as Clark Kent. There are a few moments as Clark where not only does he look and act like Reeve playing Clark, but he even sounds just like him. The fact is, Routh has competition impossible to beat - Reeve was the absolute perfect Superman/Clark. That's tough to even come to close to matching. Routh was definitely good, but when compared to Reeve, it's the best we're probably going to get.Lois Lane was OK, but Frank Langella as Perry White was horrible. Perry has turned into a soft, weak old man, nothing at all like the firebrand old-school newsman that Jackie Cooper's Perry was. Kevin Spacey was OK as Luthor, but again, like with Routh, it looks like Spacey was playing Gene Hackman playing Luthor all too often, and actually he comes across as less sincere than Routh does. He's still not bad, but I couldn't get past that all I was seeing was a Hackman imitator - Spacey didn't make Luthor his own at all. John Shea's Luthor in ""Lois and Clark"" blows away Spacey. At least Shea makes Luthor his own, and isn't a Hackman wanna-be clone.Actually the best acting in Superman Returns seems to have come from the guy who played Jimmy Olsen. I've only seen him in two things - this film, and the KISS film ""Detroit Rock City"" - and he was the best of the cast in both. In Superman Returns, he seemed the most convincing and the most sincere out of the entire cast.There are a lot of great elements in Superman Returns, especially using Marlon Brando, and the great final shot, the perfect nod to the first film. But the film, while good, just doesn't hit a home run. It is definitely a good movie, definitely entertaining and enjoyable, but there are a few things missing that keep it from being a true ""epic."" They say it cost over $250 million to make, but if anyone knows the history, it's obvious there isn't anything near that on screen and so much of that is what was spent over the past decade trying to get a Superman film off the ground. A reference to one of the original Superman titles for a new franchise, ""Superman Lives,"" is easily visible for those who know the back story.I do hope there is a sequel, because what the franchise needs, is General Zod and company to return and wreak some major havoc.I read the original Superman The Movie grossed $380 million dollars in today's dollars. There's no way this one will even begin to touch that - but a decent sequel will be a big help to the franchise.And oh yeah - despite cowardly Hollywood liberalism, having changed Superman's key phrase, to any real fans of Superman, it will always be, ""Truth, Justice, and the American way.""",0,3,stevenfallonnyc,"Jul 5, 2006",

5,Disappointing!!!!,"This movie was very disappointing. While there was nothing really bad about it, there was nothing really good about it either. It was as if Bryan Singer plastered every cliché he could think of and then tried to fit them together. Sometimes doing this works. My Best Friend Is A Vampire and Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls have every cliché you can have yet they're still entertaining because they don't take themselves too seriously. They're also short so your quickly entertained and don't have time to think out the plot holes and the lack of originality. This has a bunch of filler that doesn't work like Louis Lane being married with a child and the whole thing just collapses under its own weight. I hate to say it, but this pales in comparison to Smallville and Smallville isn't even that great of a television show. If you want to want to watch Superman at its best then watch either Smallville or Superman II (Superman II in particular).",0,1,schapers1455,"Jul 5, 2006",
6,Singer skipped X-men for this??,"I had high hopes for the Man of Steel. I grew increasingly excited as the opening credits rolled. There was some fantastic talent in the film and I couldn't wait to see what they had achieved. Perhaps this anticipation, bottled up and overflowing from the disappointment of X-men 3, was the kiss of death for my viewing experience of Superman Returns.Very soon in the movie, all sorts of plot questions developed, but the movie was agonizingly slow to answer them or didn't really address them at all. The backstory regarding Superman's departure five years earlier is woefully undeveloped. I don't feel like we can truly appreciate the RETURN of Superman if we don't understand the details of his departure.The plot is overall dull and predictable. There is only one interesting plot twist, and its potential remains largely untapped. Lex Luthor's insidious plot for world domination seemed half-assed, poorly thought out, and downright childish.The action and special effects are generally good, but also plain and unimaginative. The only involving action sequence was the airplane disaster; from there, everything seemed underwhelming, mostly involving long, slow glamour shots intending to show-off Superman's might. However, the traditional Superman music score works well, and I couldn't imagine it any other way.The pacing and editing was frequently choppy. This is a bit alarming as I never noticed this before in a Singer movie. I found myself checking my watch frequently after the halfway point. Afterwards, I asked several friends separately what they thought of the movie; they each immediately answered, ""It was a bit long."" I don't mind a movie that pauses to develop its characters and plot, but many of the slow scenes in Superman seemed pointless or worse yet, superficial.The acting was okay, but I sensed no chemistry between ANYONE. Not between Superman and Lex Luthor. Not between Superman and Lois. All in all, in spite of the incessant attempts at development, much of the interaction seemed random and meaningless.In the end, it feels not like a memorable addition to the Superman saga, but rather like another unremarkable chapter. It wasn't a horrible movie, but it was a far cry from super. Maybe it should have been called Mediocre-Man Returns or Okay-Man Returns.",7,8,Gambitt,"Jul 5, 2006",
9,Superman Has Returned,"I felt an awkward phobia prior to entering the movie theater to see Superman Returns.

Even though the critics seemed to come down hard on Kate Bosworth, I think she showed true on screen chemistry with Mr. Routh. If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out.

The only saving grace was that Kevin Spacey's character, Lex Luther, played a fair part and was marginally humorous. Not only was the film completely, SOUL-CRUSHINGLY, boring with that exception; cliché after cliché was presented as if no-one had ever seen an action film before.

A superhero budget may have empowered this popcorn flick, but a lackluster script with a so-what conclusion destroyed it for me. The plot was utterly pointless, consisting mainly of shallow encounters and the sorriest excuse for an evil plot I have ever witnessed. Sure, Spacey gives the character of Lex Luther some depth; but it seems that he overacted the character a bit, taking an idiotic plot and fighting to make it seem perilous. I'm sorry, but Singer shouldn't have to constantly remind me that the Lex's plan will do some harm. I must give credit where it is due, though: Singer does a fantastic job of creating intriguing characters and spectacular action scenes. Superman was acted with real bravado by Brandon Routh and I felt that the complex Louis Lane character was genuinely presented by Kate Bosworth. If your looking for some bang for your buck, Superman offers the goods; just don't expect a deep storyline. Full of wham-bam thrills Superman will satisfy the thrill-junkie in all of us, I just didn't think that was enough for such a high profile movie.

It really was a relief for me because with the kind of violent films out these days this was something I didn't mind my kids seeing. The scenes between Lois Lane and Superman were tastefully and so respectfully done. It brought me back to the days of a gentleman showing how to treat a lady in great films of the past and was something I wanted my kids to see. I thought that was a particularly classy and endearing element of the film that makes it so unique and uplifting in these uncertain times. I can't understand how people could not like this film. I've never seen the original Superman of the 70s so maybe that's why. I viewed this movie at face value full well knowing this is after all based on an imaginary character but isn't that why we go to see these movies in the first place? It really is about escapism and spending 2 and a half hours in another world completely unlike our own. I certainly wasn't critiquing this film in my mind the same way I would let's say United 93. It didn't feel too long or drawn out to me or my kids at all. Then again maybe we weren't trying to dig too deep for something else other than a feel good fantasy film.

I work at an IMAX theatre where we get 200 and more calls an hour about getting advance tickets for Superman Returns and it has been like this for two weeks nonstop since the movie has opened. Shows are quickly sold out and we have people showing up in groves trying to get in to each sold out show. Now I don't know what it's like out in the real rural areas but I have never seen a response to any movie we have shown and I've been working at this IMax now for 3 and a half years. Maybe it's that people are flocking to see the movie in IMAX as opposed to the regular theatres and that's where attendance is lower. I have seen the movie twice in both a regular theatre and in IMAX and I have to say there is no comparison. The experience of seeing Superman in IMAX 3D is way better in my opinion and there is nothing like it.

9,The Savior has Returned,"First off I had my doubts going into the theater. John Williams changed that upon the start of the movie. The music was very reminiscent of Star Wars in that it grabbed the audiences' attention at the very beginning and then put you in the mood for the start of the movie.The story line is a bit different, watching the first Superman helps greatly in understanding a lot of the concepts that Singer implements in this movie. His ideas of who Superman is can be seen. Christopher Reeve played an amazing Superman, but his alter-ego Clark Kent can be seen by all as down right weird. I believe that Brandon Routh played a better Clark Kent. His idea of Clark Kent seemed like a mask that many kids use in High School. Routh had the right idea that Superman uses Clark to hide his identity instead of the Reeves idea which is to show an opposite of Superman. Both hide identities but Routh's Clark does a better job. He also did a good job of reviving Clark Kent's moral dilemma with Lois Lane.Lois Lane was played by Kate Bosworth who has this innocent appearance. Margot Kidder is probably the best selection that could be made in the older Superman movies but she came off a little too aggressive for my taste. I believe that Kate Bosworth has this kind of Audrey Hepburn like way in that she is innocent, beautiful, and everyone loves her. Bosworth played a very good Lois Lane in her own inner conflicts as well.Kevin Spacey played Lex Luthor. Spacey took the role of Luthor and morphed into his own idea. He keeps the true persona of Luthor which wants to make a mark in the history of the world and he also adds in some very funny euphemisms which add more to the character. I see Luthor a little different than Spacey or Singer sees him. I would have rather had an evil persona with no comedic relief, but Singer thought that should be added.The genius of Singer is that he used a lot of psychological conflicts in his characters. The audience can sit in the brain of the theater and see the inner struggles that the characters face. Singer stayed true to the original intent of Superman. Many Americans see Superman as a 'Christ like symbol', namely Jesus. Singer (Jewish) stayed true to Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's (both Jewish) idea of Superman. Singer kept the Messiah that the Jews hope for comparing him to a Moses like figure. Moses, who leads by example, took the Jews out of Egypt, through the Exodus (which is the central focal point of Judaism). Superman, as Jor-El states in the 1978 classic, ""They can be a great people Kal-El. If they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way."" Superman is the light like Moses to lead the people to a promised land, a land where man can be great by following the light.I had my doubts about Superman Returns. Please go see the movie and judge for yourself. The only advice I can give is that if you enter the theater as a child you will leave with not only a smile but the thought that maybe you can fly.",0,0,JSeabass37,"Jul 5, 2006",

Well, it is and it isn't .......... can't say much more without giving out spoilers. :-)So, to all the naysayers here - give it another go and then see what you think, hopefully you'll have the same positive reaction as I did.",0,0,fortean2,"Jul 6, 2006",
8,A 2-and-a-half hour homage to the Donner classic. But there's nothing wrong with that,"Much of the criticism that surrounds ""Superman Returns"", director Bryan Singer's revival of the most treasured of superhero franchises, is that its story is highly derivative of the celebrated original. There's an element of truth in this notion: We again see Superman (Brandon Routh) crash land on earth – albeit this time after a 5-year layoff – and we again see an egomaniacal Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) who risks the same millions of innocent lives for the same financial gain to be had from a nefarious real estate scheme. It's indeed where the picture is at it's weakest. There are interesting plot points, however, that give us glimpses of the Superman franchise will go next – and this is a picture which will invariably be a huge success and spawn several more sequels. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has a son, for instance, and with the introduction of her fiancée, Richard (James Marsden) – who has the worst luck in the world in having to compete with the Man of Steel for Lois – the most famous and strange love triangle in superhero tradition becomes an intriguing love square.But what does the actual story matter when the picture is awash with such glorious nostalgia? Almost twenty years since the last Superman picture was released on to the silver screen, the audience is less concerned with Luthor's plot than they are with reliving Gene Hackman in Kevin Spacey – he's less of a joke-cracker, we conclude, and more twisted and evil. Bosworth's Lois is less sass and more sex, and Brandon Routh (who shares a striking resemblance to the young Chris Reeve) plays Clark Kent as less of a stumbling, bumbling dork that Reeve portrayed so humorously, and more of a sweet, caring geek. And his Superman is true to the icon: integrity to the bone as he fights for ""Truth, Justice and All That Stuff"". Routh, even when given limited dialogue, can still capture that sense of infallibility that Christopher Reeve forever forged in our imaginations.""Superman Returns"" is a lengthy 2-and-a-half hours, but it's a 2-and-a-half hour homage to the Donner classic, and there's nothing wrong with that. From the intergalactic credits that propel you right back into the seat you occupied when you first saw Superman, accompanied by a John Ottman score that gives the classic John Williams themes plenty of use, Superman Returns is a picture filled with breathtaking action sequences, solid performances, and dialogue with just the right number of quotable lines borrowed unapologetically from the original. ""You will be different"", Superman memorably recites at the closing of the picture. Well, maybe Singer hasn't. Maybe Singer didn't need to. It doesn't matter to me either way, as ""Superman Returns"" is an exceptionally entertaining and enjoyable experience that serves just as well as an extension of; or a tribute to; the Superman mythology.",1,0,jansen-aui,"Jul 6, 2006",
8,Well Done Singer!!,"Yes...I've seen it and it was very emotive, to watch a great movie with all those clichés that make's one to remember Christopher Reeve's films..from the beginning with the overture (very similar with Richard Donner's) to the final scene with Superman flying in the outer space.. I've got to say that it is not a movie entirely for fans because they don't respect the hole comic book like Spiderman, X-Men or even the outstanding Batman Begins..but it keeps its essence...It's a very good story of Superman, returning to an Earth that have learned to live without him, with amazing special effects and incredible performances by Brandon Routh (he so looked like Reeve), Kate Bossworth and of course Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor..

The acting in this movie is overall mediocre. Reeves was a better Superman, flat out. There was plenty of comic relief using Jimmy Olsen and Clark Kent's clumsy work habits.I'd recommend seeing it, but only if you're willing to accept that it's not perfect. I noticed that almost every shot of Superman was zoomed into his nose. I suppose it's because from angles, he looks a great deal like Reeves did.",1,1,shelterdrill,"Jul 6, 2006",

10,A virtuoso American masterpiece of cinema,"Last year I saw Terrence Malick's ""The New World"", and after seeing it, I felt like I had experienced a wave of euphoria, having experienced one of the most breathtaking visual feasts with a deeply resonating emotional core that I have ever seen. Last week, I saw Superman Returns and was equally stricken by it's use of rich imagery and metaphor to take me to a place of unimaginable life, on the silver screen. While some make take aim at Superman's running time and slower character-centric pace, I find that is what movies are, and should be about. At it's heart, Superman is still the everyman immigrant, he is every one of us. He represents something, and through all that has changed since Superman has left us on film, this return is the juggernaut it needed to be. It is not only a slice of American pop culture, but a piece of fine art to behold and witness. It's beautiful grace enveloped me, the visual effects were seamless and the character points and arcs were dealt with extreme care. The moments in which Superman is feeling and thinking and reacting are truly one's of cinematic history. No longer is Superman just a comic book adaptation or a film, he is a symbol, and what he symbolizes here is the resurrection of the Phoenix, the life and death of Siegfried, and Jesus Christ. If you are looking for a no-hold's barred action film, this isn't for you. Go watch Bad Boys II, which is, in all due respects, a wonderful action/exploitation film with unrelenting action sequences. If you want a thoughtful story with some awesome action pieces that resonate with the characters and visual that go above and beyond anything we have ever seen, Superman Returns is for you. The acting is top notch, the plot is tremendous and the meaning is all there. Every action taken has meaning and impact. If you see one superhero film, make it Superman Returns.",0,1,Nerdboy1423,"Jul 6, 2006",

9,Better than the others combined,"This movie blew away my expectations. I would not consider myself a huge fan of the old Superman movies although I have seen them all multiple times. They were good for their time and the first one captivated audiences by making them believe ""a man could fly"". Bryan Singer did a fantastic job directing and writing and producing this movie. The characters were perfectly cast. I wasn't so sure about Kate Bosworth going into it, but she was an excellent Lois Lane. She was headstrong, driven, great at her job and still managed to show how hurt she was that Superman had left unexpectedly. Kevin Spacey IS Lex Luther. Lex is brilliant, mean, loves irony, and has a perverse sense humor... which pretty much describes Kevin Spacey. It seems though that Bryan Singer gave James Marsden exactly the some role in this as he did in X-Men: he was one of two men torn over the same woman. This movie has without a doubt made Brandon Routh's career. His portrayal of Superman was great. In some scenes you could tell they deliberately were trying to remind you of Christopher Reeve, but in every other scene, Brandon Routh stood on his own. He put much more emotion into his part making Superman more believable as an alien-raised-by-humans-turned-superhero than Christopher Reeve ever did. I would say a 5 out of 5 on the ""re-watchability"" scale.",2,2,jdw1980,"Jul 6, 2006",

10,Singer Succeeds Again in Surprising Me,"I have become so bored by all of the action movies (actually most films in general) which, in the end, are all clones of each other in style, pacing, plotting, humor, acting style,etc and end up boring me to tears. Superman Returns stands out from the pack primarily because I didn't feel like I had seen this movie 10 times before even though the film does a nice job of continuing from the original. It also proved you could have an entertaining action movie without a constant 2 hours of explosions and unimaginative visual overload (I'm talking to you George Lucas).Each of Bryan Singer's films have a distinct flavor. He is able to be over the top without becoming a joke. He actually develops themes and ties them to imagery and plot and does it in a straightforward way. His films are totally accessible without being stupid. His big budget blockbusters still retain a homemade or independent feeling rather than being overblown overindulgent exhausting monsters (compare X-Men II to X-Men 3 for instance). Singer's signature is in the details...his slightly odd casting choices, his avoidance of schlocky pandering and his ability to work in a genre but not succumb to all of its cliché's and formulas, his success in getting a plot point across without feeling the need to beat you over the head 15 times. All this makes him possibly the best mainstream director working today.I'm sick of being assaulted and insulted when I go to the movies. Most big budget directors don't know the difference between dazzling an audience and crapping all over them (I'm talking to you Michael Bay!). I love Singer's movies because they respect the audience. The film is by no means perfect but it is a cut above the rest. Solid film-making. Just don't go in there expecting Superman to jump a jetski over a train while a ""Don't your wish your girlfriend was Hot like me"" remix plays.",1,2,kathleen-59,"Jul 6, 2006",

It's just such a shame so many of the cynics are determined to give Supe such a bitter reception. I really don't get that. These cynics just don't want to believe in a man who can fly and everything that comes with such a well-known comic character. Yes Supe definitely does come with his share of baggage but the key is too forget all about that. This latest installment is not a ""restart"" or a ""redo"" it is a ""return"". Superman comes back with lots of unanswered questions. Are they all going to be answered in this first film of the resurrected franchise? Of course not. That's why we have something called sequels. There are many excellent scenes showing Superman's vulnerable side as he tries to reconnect with this cynical world known as Earth and of course the love of his life, Lois Lane who has found herself a new man and a new life. There is great stuff here but don't go into this film trying to connect the dots with the previous Superman films.

There is plenty of unexpected twists which I won't give away that is introduced to lead into the sequels.",1,2,johnalukonesjr,"Jul 6, 2006",

Some points to note from the first 40 minutes or so: When the plane landed in the baseball field and people got out of the plane, I don't think that it was a natural reaction the baseball crowd gave the people who got out of the plane (a joyful cheer). Something more realistic would be a cheer but not with the amount of joy the crowd gave it.Superman was a terrible actor (at least as Clark Kent).

For those of you who were huge fans of the original 1978 Superman film like I was and the second Superman movie, you will find a few charming nods to those throughout. I won't give anything away but there is also a new surprise in the Superman/Lois love affair. It will leave you hanging but in a good way.

2,Why this film is not a  two-hour snooze.,"Because the overly intrusive sound effects keep everyone awake. What a boring,fastidious, stupid, predictable, cliché-ridden, poorly-casted and acted film.I went to see the film a bit out of curiosity because I wondered how someone could make an interesting movie out of such an implausible character. After all, it had been done with Batman. Well, they couldn't,it turns out. They did not even try.I was also misled by the positive ratings the film received from reviewers. Whose judgement can one trust these days...?The film is a sequence of one ridiculous scene after another with no attempt at all to create any kind of internal logic. I am ready to suspend disbelief and go along with certain outlandish topics but only on the condition that there is some effort to establish a bit of logic between the elements of the storyline.Add to this the fact that the characters are nothing more than cardboard cut-outs reciting their lines.It is to be feared that the availability of computer software to create ""dazzling"" images of crashing planes and earth-moving tremors may spell the end of good cinema. Why bother with intelligent story lines and well-crafted screen plays when all you need to entertain are a few buttons to create monstrous scenes of destruction or pandemonium? It seems that movie goers are at the mercy of studios directed by people whose purpose in life is to collect as much money as possible from 12 year-olds !",1,2,André-3,"Jul 6, 2006",
8,what the world needs,"In an era when movie makers are bent on reinventing and reimagining their superheroes and stories to match the tastes they themselves invented, there's one director out there who keeps true to the original content, and his name is Bryan Singer.Right from the beginning of the movie, with John Williams' original score triumphantly playing over the decidedly old fashioned opening credits, it's clear that Singer had no intention of changing the universe that the original Superman movies created. Sometimes reinvention is a good thing, if a universe or character gets stale. Such was the excuse for Batman Begins, with the franchise needing a fresh makeover after the disastrous last 2 installments directed by Joel Schumacher. But if you keep changing the universe in which a character that you're supposed to sympathize and connect with dwells, it tampers with the continuity of the franchise and you have to keep reconnecting with the character and its universe. That wasn't a problem in Superman Returns, because the director chose to make it a nonissue.There's no revenge driven plot, no gritty fight scenes meant to portray a darker side of the hero. There's just an old-fashioned values driven story, something that's become something of a rarity as of late. Although it's a feeling of something from the past, it almost feels refreshingly new.Brandon Routh does a very good Superman, very reminiscent of Christopher Reeves' interpretation. Kevin Spacey shines as Lex Luthor. Personally, I enjoyed his performance better than Gene Hackman's in the original.This was the feel good movie of the summer for me. In a superhero movie, you want the audience to leave the theater wishing that they could be a part of the universe of their hero, or that the hero could come be a part of theirs. I definitely felt that way after watching it. Because they didn't reinvent everything, I didn't feel like I had to reacquaint myself with Superman. He'd been gone for 5 years, much like the franchise has been gone for several, and the world missed him. I certainly look forward to his return.",1,1,mrforgetful,"Jul 6, 2006",
8,"Good, but writing could have been better","As a fan of Superman since the original TV show and having copies of all the Superman Movies, I went and saw Superman Returns.I did like the fact that it ignored the 3rd and 4th movies as they didn't really provide much to the saga and were pretty cheesy. The first and second were the best and this took it from there. I did find that the story was good and in fact a good love story.I did not find it quite as good as anticipated however. One of the things I liked about the character of the first two is not only did Superman have all his physical abilities he also had high intelligence and more importantly for his character, he had a lot of wisdom. Although Brandon did a fine job of acting out the character, I don't know how much input he had, but this superman lacked the same wisdom. His actions and the way he phrased his thoughts in one scene had the tone of being high and mighty. Of course he is high and mighty the previous superman was more humble about it. His way of dealing with the peoples response to his first big rescue since his return I found too egotistical for my taste. Perhaps because he had been away for a while and had not experienced it for some time, but I felt it went on longer than needed and I found it distasteful, or at least tacky.I didn't mind too much Lex Luther's scheme being so similar to the first movie, but did he have to take so much dialog to repeat from the first movie. Perhaps this was to benefit those who had not seen the first movie but I found it repetitious.I had read they would be using the footage of Marlon Brandon as Jor-El from the archive footage, but was hoping they would show some that had not been seen in the first movie. The collectors edition DVD of the first at least had that, was hoping they would include more in this one. Perhaps the DVD of this will have more. Or more will be shown in upcoming sequels.What I did like, that I've heard a lot of complaints about was the lack of action. Can anyone just sit back and enjoy a nice story for a change instead of constantly have non-stop action? They did have awesome special effects although I think I would have preferred more ""Green screen"" with the actual Brandon instead of so much computer generation of him. The CGI is really good these days and very good with photorealism, but common, we CAN tell the difference, but that's just a minor complaint. For the most part the special effects were great. What they did with the machine gun firing at him was probably the biggest hight of the SE team. The way they ended that with the the bullet falling to the ground was not only well done, but very humorous, if you can imagine a scene like that being funny.The story had some very neat twists regarding Lois's son and I look forward to what they do with that later. In fact I look forward to the next movie.My complaints aside I do recommend seeing this movie as it is good and very much worth seeing. I will get the DVD and hopefully there will be lots of bonus features as I'm sure there is plenty of material for them. But prepare to sit back, relax and enjoy it.",1,1,rfigley,"Jul 6, 2006",
9,Great in lots of ways!,"I must say first off before anything, Superman is one of the or maybe the greatest super hero of all super heroes. And with this film will continue his legacy. I enjoyed the movie very much and look forward to the sequels.Brandon Routh in my point of view played the role of Superman/ Clark Kent well. Don't get me wrong there will never be another Christopher Reeve, but he wasn't bad neither. At some points he kept with how Reeve's played Superman and kinda felt as if it was Reeve's.Maybe when it came to Lois Lane, they could have chose a better person but Kate Bosworth was ""ok"". We also have to except that it's not going to be the same as the original Superman.Kevin Spacey was great as Lex Luthor. He kept the darkness of the villain but was also comical at times. In the original Superman, Lex was more comical than serious. Which now it makes more sense to be serious, for the story to be more appealing. Now then in 1978 people like to know more about the story then it being comical, but that's just my opinion.The story is a bit confusing, but it made sense in the long run. Singer tried really hard to keep the feel as the original, but with his own ideas as well. The story is about the same as Richard Donner's plot but not totally which kept it interesting. The only thing I felt it lacked was about his childhood. Being that this is the first of few it should have shown more about his youth.All in all.. I feel that Superman Returns, was great and fits in with the super hero movies of this day an age. Also helps to continue into the story of Superman. Now the only thing that's left is if there are sequels.. will it be about Doomsday? Now that would be interesting, for those REAL Superman fans!!",0,1,nfiniti420,"Jul 6, 2006",
10,worth watching for multiple times.,"I don't know where to begin! The beginning credits gave me a chill that still won't go away! Totally amazing! Rouths performance is absolute stunningly well portrayed. His Clark Kent is one of the funniest I've ever seen yet still isn't half a clumsy as Reeve was. This is great! A reporter for a great Metropolitan Newspaper cant be clumsy! His Superman rivals that of Reeve and at times surpasses him. Absolutely perfectly played. Strong silent Superman who just glows of goodness as Superman should do. Outstanding! Bossworth plays Lois Lanes role to a tee. Nowhere do I even doubt her age, looks or any of that. Amazing! Spacey... wow! I knew Singer did well in using him as Luthor. He IS Lex Luthor. I got chills when he beat up Superman. Cold, manipulative, cunning, evil. A Lex Luthor through and through! The Graphics were off the chart. I even had problems seeing the difference between CGI and real life at times.I can't go into detail as there are SO many elements that I wanted to talk about that were very well done.Music: I've heard the music beforehand and I must say it fit very well with the story. Especially where the Luthor theme transforms somewhat into the Superman theme in the latter part... Well done Ottman! Gripes My gripes with this movie can be cut down to one word... editing.Not in how the scenes displayed where done but what was left out.At times (especially in the beginning) I felt the editing knife had been used to much. I wanted to see more of Young Clark, some of the Krypton exploration, Clarks talks with his mother, more dialog from the villains, even Ben should have more dialog (!) I really hope most of the cut elements will be available on the Special edition DVD come November.I know Singer had to cut a lot seeing as the movie is 2.5 hours at it is, but the fanboy in me would still like to see a 3.5 hour long movie with all those elements intact!",1,1,bush_1199,"Jul 6, 2006",
6,Solid restart and a great all-around film,"A worthy return for the Man of Steel. While not the comic book masterpiece that the original was, it is a great restart for the franchise and a pretty good film. Bryan Singer certainly loves the character of Superman, and especially the original film, as this one is chocked full of references and homages to it. The biggest problem with the film is the pacing - it drags far too much at times, and the ending is far too long. Cutting around 30 minutes would've done this film wonders. Still, it's very involving and entertaining, with great action, comedy, romance, and drama - it's got it all. Very well done.The general story itself is well executed, but parts of the plot (especially Lex's plan) are completely without logic or plausibility. But the whole idea with Superman returning, and the world learning to live without him, was quite interesting. The acting I was quite worried about going in, but it was one of the stronger points of the film. Routh was great, he embodied the character well without imitating Reeve. He really made it his own. I felt he was much better as Clark, however, and the film could've used more of him to balance all the seriousness and action. Bosworth was surprisingly good as Lois, bringing a new element to the character. Spacey was excellent as Lex, expectedly. He didn't ever overact or become silly - had just the right mix of evil and humour. No one else really stood out, but I didn't find anyone overtly annoying - not even Posey or the kid. I am glad they didn't make Marsden a jerk - made the love triangle more believable. On the whole, very good acting.The action is quite good, but there wasn't nearly enough of it. Too much melodrama and not enough plot development plagued parts of the beginning, but it cleared up and the film rolled along nicely. The climax could've have been a bit better built up, and not followed by even more melodrama, to further tighten up the story. The production design was quite good, as were the visual effects - not as obviously stunning as some other films, but very well done. In fact, all of the technical aspects of the film were solid - the shots were staged beautifully, and some of the wipes/dissolves were nicely used. The music was an excellent adaptation of the original score, and the opening credits sequence - incorporating the classic theme - was a nice nod to the original. And Singer's direction was fantastic - it's obvious he really loves the character of Superman.Overall, quite a good comic book adaptation - not as good as Batman Begins or Singer's own X-Men films, but certainly better than Spider-Man, Hulk, Fantastic Four, and the like. The plot could've used some work, the pacing was terrible at times, and the running time needed to be about 30 minutes shorter, but other than that, it was a solid film. Nothing that's going to win any awards, but very involving and entertaining, with well-staged action, comedy that felt natural, and a sufficient amount of romantic drama to balance it out. A well put together film.",0,1,charchuk,"Jul 6, 2006",
7,Casting,"I think the actor for superman did not appear old enough to fit the time line of the script. He looked only about 19 to me although I see now that he is a bit older. Also I found that Lois wasn't what I expected based on the first two Christopher Reeves movies. Lois didn't seem as spunky and vibrant as I thought she should. Maybe my expectations were off but they caused me to be disappointed. The story and the action scenes were good in my opinion. However, I would have gone with a different villain. Lex had already been done enough.

The action was intense and most of the CGI was good.After a long visit to his home planet (Krypton) Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to earth to once again save the day as Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is planning to create a new continent, which involves sinking half of the USA.Many people have been very harsh towards this movie. Although there are flaws (which action movie doesn't), it is still highly enjoyable popcorn fun. I though Routh's portrayal of Superman/Clarke Kent was fine and not an insult to Christopher Reeve. Kate Bosworth is great as Lois Lane, although Margot Kidder will always be the best. Kevin Spacey was his usual brilliant self and Parkey Posey was hilarious and great as Kitty. The look of the film is fantastic and most of the time the CGI was believable.

9,Supreman really Returns,"I just saw the new Superman movie and I have to say that I am very satisfied with it. I have read same critics and I don't agree that it's bad.First of all I loved the idea that they ignored Superman III and IV, because those 2 films are same of the worst sequels I have ever seen ( my personal favorite of the series is Superman II ).I agree that no actor will ever replace Christopher Reeves and he will always remain Superman for me. But , let's face it , Brandon Routh isn't all that bad. He certainly looks like Reeves and has a very similar voice. He isn't a bad actor , so I do believe he was a good choice. Kevin Spacey is great as Lex Lutor . I never particularly loved Gine Hackman in that role (although I lake Hackman ). The only disappointment in the acting department is Kate Bosworth and not because she is bad ( she's quite good ) but because she seems little to young for the role , especially having a 5-6 year old son . She looks lake she can't be a day over 22 , maybe 23. The film has great special effects , but that is no real surprise . I really loved the flying, it does look very real . Another thing I really loved was all those references to the original films . First the opening credits are identical to the first movie , than the use of the original music score , appearance of the late Marlon Brando and many more details .All in all , I liked this movie and I think all people should see it . All I can say for the end , I can't wait for the sequel !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If I have to rate it I would give it 8 out of 10.",1,1,cicka_s,"Jul 7, 2006",
6,vulnerability and curly lock of hair...,"I have one thing to say about this film...Superman is made human in this film...It's the thing that I really liked about this film..How Lex and his cronies beat the hell out of The Man of Steel...I mean, Superman was really hurt and helpless with all the ""green meteor rocks"" around...I just got irritated with his curly thing in his hair!!I mean,when he was in the hospital bed after being stabbed with a made-up ""green meteor rock"" knife, you'd expect him to be all messy or something! His curly lock of hair was still there!! Very unharmed!! Even in serious or heroic moments, I find myself laughing at his curly lock of hair which seems to weather all conditions..it's quite absurd,really...I'm also surprised at how old Martha is in this film! I'm also surprised as to how Lex Luthor gains money... I definitely think Michael Rosenbaum in Smallville is the best! acting wise and looks and everything.. He is the ultimate persona of Lex Luthor! James Marsden is again the OTHER guy(means he is not preferred to end up with the lead actress)...I have noticed this in 3 films of his already... X-MEN series, the notebook and superman returns... what is it with him and being the other guy of the lead lady? But I guess people should watch this just to have something to talk about. And this film is just a prologue for the next one.Oh yeah, their(Superman and Lois') son is just the most adorable thing!! he is so cute!! I really thought he's Macaulay Culkin's brother..

8,An enjoyable renewal of the franchise,"First up, Superman Returns is a very faithful continuation of the original series. I choose that phrase carefully. Superman here is not reinvented (like Bale's Batman) nor parodied (Clooney's). He follows in the footsteps of Reeve's big screen original.The opening titles - done in the style of the original but improved through CGI are a wonderful blend of retro nostalgia and future technology. It's all very pleasing... You get the goosebumps from awakening the childhood memory plus the satisfaction of a modern day CGI trip well done.Seeded throughout the film are little production design details that hark back to the Reeve era. The pointy spaceship that takes superman from Krypton... The palace of crystals and there's even a cast member from the past. As a viewer you feel very connected to the story, first hand from the screen in front of you and viscerally from the memories of the original. It all feels right.A lot's been said about ""Unknown Brandon Routh"" in the title role. I seem to recall that Christopher Reeve was an unknown before he landed the role of Superman. Routh turns in an excellent performance. His Clark Kent is a close facsimile of Reeve's. But he makes Superman his own. Herein lies the first shadow. Routh gets to show his physical vulnerability when there's Krypton around but I didn't see much emotional vulnerability at all in the 154 minutes. Yes there is back story between him and Lois but I the man of steel didn't bear his heart. He is however a talented actor, easy on the eye and possessed of the sort of heroic modesty that makes him a very enjoyable watch.The real disappointment for me was Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. This Lois is rather pretty, rather shallow rather successful and rather distracted. And I think it's the ""rather"" in all of these which is the real Achilles heel. The performance just lacks commitment and gusto. Whatever you thought of Margot Kidder, she gave a convincingly emotional performance. I've no doubt it's terribly difficult carving out a defined niche as the protagonist's love interest, but I just wasn't engaged by Bosworth's ""successful career woman-mother"". She had no drive.Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor inhabits the antagonist with grim driven determination. He's meaner and less camp than Hackman's original but lacking a foil like Hackman's Otis (Ned Beatty). He does however have his very own Miss Teschmacher in Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey). He has some great lines, some great visual jokes, the kids will want to Boo him and if I had one criticism about his evil plans, they're just not quite evil enough. His world conquering plan was just a little bit ""Dr. Evil"" for me.The essential plot will be familiar to all those who remember the originals. I'm not going to give anything away. It's watchable, enjoyable and doesn't get our superhero doing anything that jars with our recollection of his character from the time before.The script is snappy and very contemporary. It has plenty of dialogue and visual jokes to amuse both the adults and the kids. The characters are given appropriate, amusing and engaging things to do and say. One of the biggest chuckles came from a very new take on the infamous ""it's a bird, it's a plane"". You'll know it when you've got there. Very very well done.The closing credits pay tribute to Christopher and Dana Reeve ""with love and respect"". And you know what, that captures the mood of the whole film perfectly.10/10 minus 2 for Bosworth's Lane and lack of emotional depth. This new franchise will continue and I will be looking forward to it.",0,1,Mahne,"Jul 7, 2006",

8,A very competent rendering of Superman,"When I heard that Superman Returns was about to be released, I went and watched the 1970's Superman. I was very disappointed, but probably because I had very high expectations graphically speaking (what with the Spider-Men, Batman Begins, Fantastic Four, X-Men). I was very reluctant to go see Superman Returns. But I must say, the director of this film has taken a very hard-to-portray super hero and instilled within him a sense of reality and darkness (a very subtle one, of course) that I failed to predict could be done. Superman was not goofy, and many times throughout the film, incredibly believable, providing you allow your imagination to guide you through the film. Critics of super-hero blockbusters will HATE it. Kevin Spacey plays a superb Luthor, far better than Hackman's slap-stick criminal. True, Spacey adds some humor to the role, as any good portrayer of Luthor should do, but he too incorporates a darkness that makes the film much more dramatic and eventually pulls you to the edge of the seat wondering what in the world, or worlds, is going to happen.",0,1,lagorman,"Jul 7, 2006",
8,best popcorn of the summer,"Superman Returns is a great summer film. Singer has done an incredible job bringing together all the amazingly complicated elements that go into blockbusters today without sacrificing the heart of the original Superman. Compared to the fairly enjoyable Pirates of the Caribbean sequel, Superman shows its strength. Of the two, Superman Returns is tighter and sharper and doesn't suffer from the as much self indulgentism that makes Pirates such a LONG wandering film.To enjoy the effort of the film even more I highly recommend the video pod cast released by Warner Brothers over the past year, titled ""Bryan's journal."" It follows Bryan and his crew throughout the film making process. Undoubtedly this ""journal"" will appear again on the DVD release, but check it out now while you can still appreciate the end result on the big screen!!",0,1,chrissyafrica,"Jul 7, 2006",

1,"Mediocre, Unspiring and Dull","Well its not really truly awful but compared to what it could of been and should have been - yes. Over 25 years since the definitive version and plenty of opportunity to evolve story lines and characters. Special effects barely workmanlike. Story ideas dismal and totally uninspired, a rehash of superman clichés and ""been-there's"" and ""done-thats"". Where was the Bryan Singer that made the X-men films? He sleep-walked through this. Laughs and chuckles, sly or otherwise?. Absent. The whole thing had a feel of a less then competent tribute to 80's disaster films. Everyone has their opinion and certainly most of the professional critics seem to like this picture but I cannot believe from their positive reviews that we saw the same film. Compare this turkey to the inventiveness, sheer exuberance, and witty dialogue of another summer movie like Pirates of the Caribbean 2.

3,Superman Returns lacks a soul,"If Batman can do it, why can't Superman? I'd have to guess that was the ideology behind actually making the return of Superman a reality. Sure, it has been in the works since what seems like the Crucifixion, but the push through the door had to have been the runaway success of Christopher Nolan's dark rebirth for the caped crusader. Hopefully, the same could be expected from the new Superman, unlike the camp the older films reduced themselves to. Unfortunately, Superman Returns doesn't have nearly the same quality as other recent comic books movies, running way too long and lacking any soul whatsoever.The movie isn't a reinvention of the series like Batman Begins was, but instead a direct continuation of the Christopher Reeve movies from the '80s. After visiting the ruins of his home planet Krypton, Superman (Routh) returns to Earth after a five year absence. He finds the world in pretty much the same state it was in before, and manages to get his job back at the Daily Planet as Clark Kent. The one change is that his eternal love, Lois Lane (Bosworth), is now a mother and a Pulitzer Prize winner for her article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" She is also long-time engaged to pilot Richard White (Marsden).Around the same time, Lex Luthor (Spacey) re-emerges after regaining a small fortune by marrying a dying widow. He then travels to the Fortress of Solitude and steals some crystals which can apparently create land. His evil scheme: to create a new continent and, in the process, drown the USA. It is now up to Superman to both stop Luthor and regain the love of Lois Lane.It isn't even worth going into how stupid Luthor's plan is. First and foremost, it is really vague as to how creating a new continent will gain him any capital. Maybe as a terrorist weapon, but the idea is so far-fetched that it doesn't seem likely. Secondly, the fact that there are crystals which create land is just so mind-bogglingly stupid that it takes you right out of the movie. Finally, the fact that Luthor avoided prison just because Superman couldn't make his court date is just stupid.The plot as a whole just doesn't really feel that important. The movie shortchanges Luthor to concentrate on the dynamic between Lois and Superman, making Superman out as a homewrecker, whisking Lois away from her presumably happy family. The sideplot involving Lois' child opens up a whole different batch of plot holes. The story never really manages to gain any interest because of a heavy dose of clichés and stupidity.At least some action would hopefully make up for the lack of plot, but the action really isn't all that great compared to other superhero movies. There isn't much of any fighting in the movie, so all the action is Superman saving people from various situations. Aside from a plane crash early in the movie, none of this is really all that exciting, as it is all too small-time for Superman. The plane crash is a very nice scene with some solid CGI, but the fact that the highlight of the film takes place roughly a half-hour into the movie makes the rest of the film quite boring.The main thing that makes the action boring is that there is never really a sense of danger. With characters like Batman or Spider-Man, we can feel their pain and with the X-Men it is always possible one of them could die. Superman is a seemingly invincible tank who can do just about anything and everything the writers can imagine, as long as he stays away from green rocks. Since the climax of the action occurs relatively early, we know that there is no danger of him failing simply because there is no way that Lois could be killed. Since Superman essentially can't die and we know that the writers won't kill off Lois, essentially all tension is gone from the movie.On the acting front, there are also many problems. Brandon Routh has a good look for Superman, but he doesn't really bring anything to the role, making him seem like more of a caricature than a character. As Clark Kent, he just seems to fade into the background, hardly attracting any attention from the audience. Kate Bosworth is quite flat as Lois Lane, not giving us any reason to care about her the way Superman does. In fact, to those who have never visited the world of Superman before, you'd be left wondering why Clark cares about Lois so much.The biggest disappointment (even if not the worst job) is Kevin Spacey, who plays Luthor more like a cartoon than a sinister villain. It really is a shame, as some of Spacey's best roles have been the sinister (Se7en, anyone?), but it seems more like Luthor is Elmer Fudd to Superman's Bugs Bunny. The extensive supporting cast is almost unnoticeable as Luthor chews up as much of the scenery as possible. On a side note, Kal Penn (Kumar himself) is completely shortchanged, having practically no lines and very little character. Nice way to treat a cult favourite actor.Overall, Superman's return is a fair bit of a mess. The plot is weak, the action is sparse, the tension is non-existent and the acting is all over the map. Sure, there is always the off-chance the next movie (because we all know there will be another one) will be better, but based on how this one, it is safe to say that we shouldn't get our hopes up. In a world that craves the darkness of Batman, the angst of Spider-Man and the rebellion of the X-Men, the underwear-on-the-outside Superman just can't fit in.34%",2,2,JimD73,"Jul 7, 2006",
10,Superman Returns,"Superman Returns is set in the present day where it has been several years since Superman has been seen or saved anybody. We find out that for the past few years Superman has been investigating his dying home planet and that is why he has been away for so long. He ends up coming back to Earth and as his alter ago Clark Kent he gets his job back at the newspaper. Having saved some people already the town is very happy to have him back, but his old love interest Lois Lane is not having been mad at him for leaving before. Superman now finds out that Lois has a boyfriend and a son. Meanwhile, Superman's arch nemesis Lex Luthor is out of prison and hatching a new plan which will lead to the death of many people. Lex also has plans to stop Superman once and for all and it will be up to him to stop Lex and to change Lois's mind about him and save the city from disaster. Superman Returns has good direction, a good screenplay, good performances by the entire cast and good film editing. In my opinion the original Superman film from 1978 is the best superhero movie of all time. Having liked the original so much I wasn't sure how much I would like this fifth film in the series, but overall I was not disappointed. The film remains faithful to the characters of the original film and what I mean by that is Clark Kent is still a charming and nice guy as is Superman, Lois Lane still has a lot of spunk and attitude and Lex Luthor although being serious a lot of the time makes a joke out of himself and has amusing sidekicks to go along with him. These are several things I liked about the original so much and that this film captured faithfully. The film also doesn't always go for big action scenes and instead once again re-introduces us to these characters and shows us what is going on in their lives and shows their feelings of love and hurt especially between Superman and Lois Lane. I was just as compelled and entertained by the scenes with Clark Kent and Lois Lane or Superman and Lois Lane for that matter where there is no action, but just meaningful conversations and situations. But then when we get to the action scenes they are very entertaining and interesting and kept my attention. I also liked the pace of this film and thought it moved along well and just was a great addition to the Superman series. The original Superman, I still think is probably the greatest superhero movie of all time and this one does it justice by being a great sequel and probably the best superhero movie of at least the past ten years or so. I know I gave last year's Batman Begins a really good rating, but I liked this film even more. This film was a great achievement and a worthy addition to the series and die-hard Superman fans will not be disappointed. One of the best films so far this year.",0,1,cultfilmfan,"Jul 7, 2006",

They couldn't have chosen a better Lex and Superman. Brandon Routh embodied everything Superman should be. The special effects were awesome. I had the pleasure of watching it in an IMAX theater with some scenes being shown in 3-D and if anyone has the opportunity I would strongly recommend doing the same it just adds to an already great movie.

3,See it at a Budget- if even then.,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie at full price.I know that's a strange thing to say, considering the ratings that other users have put on this particular movie- the amount of ""10s"" outweigh all other votes combined- but in my honest and humble opinion, the only breath of fresh air in the entire movie was Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey)- and even he overacted in the boat scene.Please don't get me wrong- Bryan Singer, Michael Dougherty, and Dan Harris wrote an excellent screenplay. I have no qualms about the direction of those three for where they are taking the Big S; they did write a screenplay that I felt I needed to sit through the entire movie in order to see what was coming up next.Still, I think that at least 45 minutes of this movie should have wound up on the cutting room floor. The ""romantic"" portion was shoved down our throats, time and time again. I'm sorry- I get enough saccharine in everything else, I don't need to feel as if I'm going into a diabetic coma when I'm in the theater. It would also have turned this 2 hour, 34 minute movie into something more palatable, with these particular actors/actress. (More on this below.) Brandon Routh (Clark Kent/Superman) and Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane) were miscast. Brandon captured the feel of Clark Kent to a ""T"" (reminiscent of the late Christopher Reeve), but he doesn't have the on-screen persona to pull off the Man of Steel, nor the acting ability to fully utilize the relationship and chemistry with Lois Lane. As far as Kate Bosworth is concerned, she was so wooden, I'm surprised she didn't sprout leaves. (If it had the chemistry we saw between Sam Raimi's Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker/Spiderman) / Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane Watson), or even Brian Singer's Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) / Famke Janssen (Jean Grey) in X-Men, then this would have been a much better movie, overall.) Kevin Spacey literally stole the show; he was the only actor in the entire movie who had any 'oomph' to his character at all. I would sincerely welcome him into any future Superman movies; he does the cool, calculating Lex Luthor to perfection. He literally stole the movie, and his acting was enough to give this 3 stars. Unfortunately, he had a moment or two of overacting (Boat scene)- perhaps to make up for the wooden performances of Brandon and Kate.James Marsden (Richard ""Perry"" White) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen) did ""okay"" jobs; nothing to write about.Will I go back to the theater to see this movie again? NO.Will I purchase this DVD? NO. Kevin Spacey is the only redeeming actor in this particular movie, and even so, his on-screen time was limited, due to the romantic angle that felt (at best) like a teenage infatuation.Would I watch this on network or cable television? Doubtful.-- Steve",0,1,sjmpj1,"Jul 7, 2006",
5,Superman is dead...to me,"Superman comes back after five years, searching for the planet Krpyton, and has to save the world from Lex Luthor. This is the first Superman movie I've seen and it was a bad first impression of Superman movies for me. Forty minutes into it, I was already bored. It was ever so predictable. Of course your jaws will drop when you see the ridiculously amazing things he does, like landing a Boeing 747, but that won't last. You'll know that he'll be able to save them and stop this and the only thing that'll stop him is kryptonite. While watching this movie, I had a thought, superheroes can only save lives. They can't save souls. They can't save or treat a mentally disturbed person or someone who had a traumatic experience, unless they have a Phd. in psychology. I can say that Superman is superficial. Anyway, it's like there is nothing he can do , physically speaking, and that can get boring. There was nothing wrong with the actors' performances, but something was lacking between Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, it felt dull. Superman fans might like the fact that the Daily Planet people not for once suspect Clark Kent to be Superman, but it does get old, because it does for me. I have to give credit to Bryan Singer for keeping the look of the original movies and Brandon Routh plays Superman just like Christopher Reeve did. Fans would probably enjoy this and will wonder if there will be a sequel: the ending does leave audiences suspended. Superman Returns is only eye candy and even though most superhero movies don't need an excellent story, the writers still have to try and they didn't try at all. It's not a waste of money, because you'll realize how bad it is and if you do, be wary of some corny scenes.

6,At least they preserved the Sanctity of the Secret Identity.,"Interesting fact.WHILE I WAS GOING THROUGH THE DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKUP OF THE VOTES I REALISED THAT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY WAS ABSOLUETELY TRUE. WOMEN HAVE VOTED FAR HIGHER FOR THIS FILM THEN MEN. THE HIGHEST VOTE COMES FROM WOMEN UNDER 18. NOT YOUR STANDARD AUDIENCE FOR SUPERHERO FILMS.... BUT THIS WILL ILLUSTRATE WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY.For starters let me say that this is exactly what I expected........ in the quest for wider audiences and a better demographics. Movie makers are increasingly making so called action movies more and more emotional, dramatic and romantic they have blurred the line between all genres of films in the quest for better returns.Thus I automatically lowered my expectations and went into this movie expecting the same melodrama that I have come to expect from all action films.HOWEVER I HAD TO SEE THIS FILM THANKS TO MY OWN Curiosity AND THE HYPE SURROUNDING IT.This movie may have focused to much on the drama but other than that and a couple of other things this movie had a lot of things going right for it.The Airplane rescue scene was brilliant it had all the elements of suspense, action, technical wizardry and a dash of humour all of which make for a perfect beginning this for me was the best scene in the film.Other than that the show was mostly stolen by the brilliant Kevin Spacey and ABSOLUETELY SPECTACULAR PARKER POSEY. Much has been said about Kevin Spacey but Parker Posey for me was pure serendipity even the scenes with histrionics was carried out with élan. No overacting or over dramatization here, kitty has traditionally had a soft corner for superman, somehow she was able to play down even that, for me the villainous duo and their chemistry as also their henchmen stole the show.This may have been the only movie where the henchmen have spent so much time on screen yet have hardly uttered any words, deliberate or not the henchmen yet stood out especially the one with the tattoo. Indias own Kal Penn unfortunately was also at the receiving end although he is present throughout the movie his dialogues (which he claimed were many ) were cut.Compare to that the chemistry between superman and Lois lane was shoddy. This may have been the most romantic superman ever but even then either the casting (FOR ME THE DEMOGRAPHICALLY CORRECT KATE BOSWORTH WAS A MISTAKE SHE Neither HOT NOR PRETTY ENOUGH TO BE LOIS LANE) or the acting talents of Brandon Routh are to blame.This is by far the most unidimensional superman he feels only 2 emotions love and his sense of duty. Save for a couple of scenes the humour is non-existent. Superman takes himself way to seriously. Where is the comic book humor and bravado that we learned to love. Superman with issues is not superman hes batman. Hell even batman went through a phase where he was full of humour.Save for the airplane scene the action scenes are entertaining but nothing exceeds expectations for a movie where you expect at least the action scenes to be world class there is but one genuinely exciting scene. The rest of the movie is crammed full of good action scenes but none worth mentioning.The movie feels like a regular soap opera it even ends on a note of drama. A brilliant scene with Kevin and Posey towards the end would have been far more apt. Its filled with twists and turns and scenes that seem straight out of bold and the beautiful or EKTA KAPOORS K SERIALS. I couldn't help but laugh at implications of it and I'm sure other will see the humour in it too.The movie regularly hints at these and even though I always get them right I'm sure other to will see the early signs of it. THANKS TO MY FRIEND EVEN WON A BET. (THANKS FOR THE MONEY ABHISHEK).I am not a supporter of the Same old fashioned treatment to superhero movies but neither would I like to see a super sensitive superman instead of making every superhero vulnerable and emotional how about showing us scenes where he fails or needs help.Also the promotions for the mobile phone and digicam were far from subtle but sublime compare to Indian movies.SORRY BUT I WILL NOW STOP CRIBBING ABOUT THE SAD STATE OF MODERN DAY ACTION FILMS.Thankfully although superman has the worst disguise (hahah) unlike hulk and spider-man at least he still has his secret identity.Special mention for James Marsden ,Frank Langella and Sam Huntingtonwho played their supporting roles with panache. Frank and Sam especially gave us some much needed comic relief.In all an ordinary film that just about meets expectations thanks mainly due to great performances from the villains and the supporting cast and a couple of memorable scenes.Curiosity and hype are major reason for watching films and if you want to watch this film for these reasons then please lower your expectations and go and enjoy this film.+S great acting from the villains and supporting cast especially Posey. Couple of memorable scenes. top of the line special effects.+/- s Brandon Routh (looks like superman but has yet to display any acting talent), interesting but melodramatic twist -s Kate Bosworth, overly romantic and melodramatic, unidimensional superman.total 6/10 ( thanks to lowered expectations in absolute terms more of a 5) PS IN RETROSPECT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS MOVIE HAS At least A DOZEN LOGICAL AND SIMPLE PLOT HOLES SOME OF WHICH ARE PRETTY EVIDENT IN THE FILM HOWEVER THIS HARDLY AFFECTED THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF THE FILM.",0,0,kooleshwar,"Jul 8, 2006",

9,Superman Really Returns,"I am a big fan of the superman franchise. I was kinda into the comic books, but comic books has never been my thing. I remember when I saw the very first Superman movie and it made me believe I could fly. And no that was not a shot out to R. Kelly. :P Then Superman II and III added even more wonderment to the man of steel and made him so human and so believable.Now in Superman Returns the journey returns in a powerful. The movie starts like 10 years or so after Superman III and Superman has just came back from a 5 year journey to Krypton and Lois is engaged with a child.Superman starts off so cool with a remake of the opening credits using the original score that you remember from all of the superman movies. This movies is fast, slick, creative and most importantly the scenes were Superman actually fly seem so real.A whole new generation of superman fans will be born in the generation that has been used to X Men, Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Electra, Dare Devil, Blade, and host of other comic book to screen superstars in the last decade. But Superman returns is in a league all of it's on.Superman and Spiderman I think are the best of the comic book to screen series because of the human element that you can relate to in each of them.In Superman returns Superman struggles with being the only person left from his planet. You know that is such a human thing so many people fell when they are the outcast in a situation. There was one scene with Lois that Superman took on an almost Jesus quality when they referred to him as being the savior of the world.This movie is not campy like the first superman movie, it's a little dark and intense at time, but overall I think this is the best Superman Movie since Superman I.",0,0,RecoWilliams,"Jul 8, 2006",

9,"Faster, stronger and better than ever","Bryan's Superman is a wonderful movie. The movie has everything you need: drama, comedy, love, amazing special effects, great story, talented actors and intense action. In this sequel (of the first two movies), superman leaves earth for five years in order to find his home planet, Krypton. The movie begins with his return which is very painful to him since the love of his life, Lois Lane, is a mother and it appears to him that she doesn't need him anymore. If you are wondering where he got that idea from, well that's because Ms. Lane got a Pulitzer prize for writing an article about ""why the world doesn't need Superman"". In the course of the movie Lois finds out that the world, just like her, needs Superman. A movie without a villain is not a movie, therefore we have Lex Luthor, who is a super villain and archenemy of Superman. Luthor, as always, wants to kill superman and take over the world. But as we all know, in movies, bad guys can't defeat heroes.The cast of this film is a great one. Every actor is so talented and gives dimension to his character. Brandon Routh is amazing as both Clark Kent and Superman. He is tough, strong, funny and looks good in that outfit. Kate Bosworth proves that she can be dramatic and funny (No doubt that she is Lois Lane). Kevin spacey looks great without hair. For those of you who have seen the previous Superman movies, you can see the resemblance between Kevin and Gene Hackman (act and appearance). NO doubt that they both did a good job. Frank Langella (Perry White) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen) do not disappoint us either.The amazing flying scenes are breathtaking and the special effects are fantastic. No doubt that the technology is much more advanced nowadays. This is definitely the best time for superman to return to the big screen. The sound, the picture and the scenes are unbelievably overwhelming. While watching this movie I couldn't move from my seat and for the first time I was barely talking during a movie.So all of you, Superman fans, boys and girls, out there: YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE ON A BIG SCREEN AND DON'T WAIT FOR THE DVD TO COME OUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO FUN IN THAT!",0,2,Amethyst-El,"Jul 8, 2006",
8,Good but forgettable,"I was highly anticipating this film, as it is that i have been a big superman fan since i was a kid. The first time i saw the film i was sorely disappointed and very upset. I have seen it twice since, and the movie has improved each time. My three main concerns with the film are these: Bosworth as Lois had no panache, Routh could have been more endearing, the utter lack of American patriotism, and the refusal to admit Metropolis is essentially New York City. First off, i thought Bosworth was sufficient at best as Lois Lane, but she wasn't interesting nor captivating. Kidder in the role in Superman 78' had a ton of spunk and flavor, and Bosworth had very little. I know they were trying to make the character more mature, with a kid and more experience and all, but without her fire and quick wit , Lois was a bore and i really didn't care about her. Secondly I thought Brandon did just fine as Clark and Supes, but I didn't think, nor did i have the expectation, that he came close to surpassing the great Christopher Reeve as my superman. Reeve's performance was iconic: he hit Clark Kent out of the park and his Superman made me believe in heroes as a kid. He has a great warmth as the big man, and you felt as if he could jump into your life if you were to ever get into trouble. Brandon, as a pretty much unexperienced actor, did a good job, trying to emulate Reeve as much as possible. I just thought he wasn't given enough as Clark or Superman to really grab you out of your seat and make him win your heart. I think if there will be sequels, he will continue to improve. Thirdly, what the hell is with the lack of Americanism? Whether it's Singer's political views or a sellout attempt to win over a bigger chunk of the foreign market, either way i am really disappointed. ""Does he still stand for truth, justice, all that stuff"" ? Give me a break. Superman is the essential American superhero, and if the world can't deal with that, well that they can take a hike. He's for the American way all the way. Lastly, i admit i am a New Yorker at heart, and i loved the New York feel to Superman 78', and the reversal of that thinking made me mad. Without the NY feel, you lose the hustle of the city, the Daily Planet was virtually worthless, and it added to Bosworth and Langella's (Perry White) poor performances. All and all, after seeing it three times, i am somewhat satisfied with the movie. I thought Spacey was OK, he could have for sure done a much better job, but whatever. Sam as Jimmy Olsen was fantastic, James Marsden was great as always as Richard White, and i though Parker Posey was very funny as Kitty. I think Singer did a cakewalk with this one, going for a formula instead of really going for the gusto. The visuals were fantastic, as would be expected. The music was disappointing, I though Ottman missed a lot of opportunities for some great cues. Going back to Ottman, who also was co-editor, i thought the editing definitely put a dent in this film. So, i suggest you see it and find out for yourself. I'm just happy the man of steel is back, but lets get a better showing next time.",1,1,dawalrus1987,"Jul 8, 2006",

Superman is a character that stands for good, and only that. The only flaw, if its even a flaw, is that he's in love. This is the complaint I get when talking about this movie withe others is: ""why did they waist our time with that love story and pack it with more action?"" When you pack action into a movie and slide the viewers along a roller-coaster you need to have moments of rest..just like a roller-coaster. That structure creates a pure, and exciting ""superhero' movie, like Superman Returns. In contrast to Pirates of the...not waisting my time with the title, the pack action in left and right. The viewers are so sidetracked they ignore the little story that exists. Superman throws every right move from an incredible title sequence to some some of the most beautifully crafted action sequences ever created. With a fully constructed three-part epic story intertwined. If your going to portray a hugely followed and influential moral comic book hero like Superman, then deliver it right. Since there really isn't a Superman, then I guess we need this movie.

8,Exccellent Summer blockbuster,"Now that I have seen the movie this was supposed to be competing with (POTC2) for our summer movie money, I think I am better able to comment on Superman Returns.Short review: This is the must see summer movie so far.Bryan Singer did an excellent job of revitalizing Superman. I fortunately caught the original on TV a few days before watching the movie, so was able to see how well Superman Returns works as a continuation on I and II. (I do think it is wise for everybody to forget that III and IV existed) Credit Brandon Routh with a performance that has the largest contribution to the success of the film. Generally, Brandon *is* superman. Occasionally, it seems like he is channeling Christopher Reeve directly in his performance. He is absolutely flawless as the geeky/clumsy Clark Kent (Probably my favourite parts of the film). As Superman, he goes beyond extremely convincing.Kevin Spacey was brilliant as Lex Luthor...and I believe he brought a more convincing, menacing and evil Lex to the big screen. No surprise really...Kevin Spacey is as close to a sure thing as you can get as a character actor.Everyone else was OK...anyone could have done what Kate Bosworth did, but I did enjoy Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olson.The story, with one exception, was good. There were a couple of choices as far as plot twists that I didn't like...but overall the storyline was enjoyable. (I would have liked to see more of the humour that Clark Kent provides, and less of the moody Superman with baggage that we see) Visually, this movie was amazing. If anything, I was looking forward to seeing what the special effects wizards were going to be able to do with this, and I was certainly not disappointed. There were a few times that the SuperCape looked a bit cartoony, but generally the CGI was fantastic.Definitely worth seeing at the theatre...but I'll be purchasing as well to revisit when it releases.",1,1,donatolla,"Jul 8, 2006",

3,Hardly any redeeming factors here...,"Within ten minutes of opening, it's evident that Superman, rather than returning to cinema, should have stayed put. This movie, helmed by comic movie whiz Bryan Singer, has nothing in common with his earlier and better films. Everyone hoping that Superman Returns is on the level with the excellent comic films X-Men, or Spiderman 2... Sorry. It's closer in relation to horrific CG dominated fare like Attack of the Clones and The Hulk.Superhero movies are never about the plot, but Superman's is just awful. After returning from his galactic journey to find his homeworld, The Man of Steel finds himself in the middle of this evil plot masterminded by none other, than Lex Luthor. After finding Superman's arctic hideout, Lex confiscates the alien technology hidden there, which allows him to ""grow"" his own continent, destroy the world, and charge people to live on his islands since there's nowhere else to live. The scheme, at best, is retarded. At worst, sounds like something RE/MAX might think up.I'm astounded at how bad the acting was for this movie. Even a versatile actor like Kevin Spacey, who is normally fantastic, was simply bad. I understand what he was trying to do, and how he was attempting to bring a sort of ""insanity"" to the character, but it fails. And because of that failure, we're left with a very muddled and confused interpretation of Lex Luthor. Kate Bosworth fairs better than most of the cast. She plays Lois Lane fine, but never taps into the deeper character. But, no one cares about them. Superman, is where it's all at. Sadly, it's arguably the movie's greatest failure. Brandon Routh never comes close to tapping into the emotions and flaws that make the character of Superman. He's all surface and good looks, and not once does he show a hint of emotion. Seriously, I think the casting director just looked for whoever looked best in the tights.Even considering the horrible story, and bad acting, that's not why Superman Returns is such a bore. The main reason is, that Bryan Singer was content to make a surface movie. One could say that it's because it's so predictable, but that's not it. All comic movies are predictable (save for Daredevil, which is very good) but what makes them worthwhile are two things: The action, which Superman fails miserably, and the deeper emotions of the heroes. Sam Raimi did it extraordinarily well with the Spiderman films, Mr. Singer did it himself with the first 2 X-Men movies, but not in Superman. Everything here is ""flash over substance"".One bright spot in this terrible movie, is Kitty. Or more specifically, Lex Luthor's ""henchwoman"", (hey, I don't make the words up, I just write with 'em) played to perfection by Parker Posey. Her wacky, energetic role, while hilarious and incredibly entertaining, is out of place. She belongs in a better, much more fun Superman film. If the filmmakers had built the movie around her energy, they would have had a smash hit on their hands.But sadly, they didn't and it isn't. What we have instead, is a CG driven mess that eerily resembles the Star Wars prequel films. Nothing works in this movie. Not a single thing. I'll be the first to admit, I've never liked Superman. I've always thought he paled in comparison to the more intriguing characters of Batman and Spiderman. This movie does nothing but prove me right. But, I know some of you die-hard fans will go see this, despite anything I say. Don't say I didn't warn you.",0,0,KarisLOVER,"Jul 8, 2006",

,Why the world needs Superman,"One doesn't have to travel very far now days to witness or experience man's inhumanity to man first hand. The nightly news is full of gruesome images and stories of tragedy and horror that often seem to challenge even the most forthright and experienced news anchor to maintain some semblance of calm detachment while reading the text. Watchers are numb to the horror as well, or so it seems. Many are simply sinking further into the cesspool of delayed stress syndrome that appears to have engulfed much of the civilized world since the fall of the twin towers. In the midst of all this, Americans prepare to set off Fourth of July fireworks that may be unsettling reminders of another horror to those of us who have just escaped the grip of a vicious conflict half way around the world. Enter, Superman, red cape flapping in the wind and his dark curl falling onto his forehead enticingly as he once again reaches out to rescue animals, children, adults, neighborhoods, cities and the world with little effort. I grew up with Superman. Class bullies and years of uncertainty and insecurity plagued my youth and drove me to seek refuge in the arms of someone invincible and untouched by the mundane struggles of mere mortals. No matter how tough things got, in fact… the tougher things got, a piece of my young soul was somehow strengthened by imagining that somewhere out there in the vast universe there could actually be a Superman… a man totally devoid of fear and uncorrupted by vice or greed… a man completely dedicated to fighting for the preservation of truth and consumed with the concept of justice for all.In my youth, Superman fought for truth, justice and the American way. This latest movie, Superman Returns, makes it very clear that Superman is fighting for truth and justice all over the world though. That may seem like an insignificant departure from the original script, but it is, in view of today's global unrest, extremely important. For it is indeed the world that needs Superman now, not just America.The world needs Superman (and Supermen) because the world needs hope. Hope that good can conquer evil. Hope that it does indeed pay off to be truthful, even when everyone around you is lying, hope that things will indeed get better, and hope that there will be another tomorrow. Superman does all of this without irritating anyone with religious or political beliefs.Superman is a concept, not just a figure in tights swinging from wires. Superman embodies the inner goodness that is an expression of the true nature of human beings. We loose track of that in times like this. We tend to get swept away by all the anger and horror. Superman has returned to remind us of some very important things.

,Believe..........,"I recently trekked to the theater to view ""Superman Returns"", unsure of what I would find. A long time fan of Christopher Reeve's film Superman, I felt that it would be nearly impossible to live up to it. In my heart I truly didn't want the new film to deviate so far off the original's track that it lost itself. In my eyes, Christopher Reeve is and will always be Superman, but I was willing to give the new actor a shot. I'm glad I did. He did a wonderful job above and beyond my expectations for the film. And I give a heartfelt thanks to Bryan Singer for adhering so closely to the first Superman films. Tears nearly came to my eyes when the original theme music played at the beginning. For over two hours, I sat in that theater, lost in another world that I hadn't had the privilege to visit in almost thirty years. A place where good conquers evil and a man in a cape can be counted on as a hero and a savior. I left wanting to see the movie again and again. Brandon Routh's Clark Kent was so similar to Christopher Reeve's that it was like coming home. He has made the role his own in a soulful, stolid portrayal of the Man of Steel without losing the basic characterization that Reeve brought to the role. Needless to say, I enjoyed the film beyond words and, though I sorely miss Reeve, I think we've gotten the next best thing.

In many ways, Superman Returns is a rehashing of the original Superman movie, without any of the emotional attachment.

2,"superman returns, just another movie disaster....","i am a big fan of the old movies and i did have high expectation, since the older movies are very good. the movie started very good but after the first airplane rescue, it just went downhill. i was gonna give it a rating of 7 stars but ended up with 2 stars. the only good thing with the movie is kevin spacey that act as lex luthor and there the movie gets its 2 stars from.the new superman movie is a totally disaster and failure in my opinion, and just another movie we don't need. the last movie was made in 1987, this new one is like 5 years after that one. so the year is 1992 in superman returns, you just gotta wonder what the hell a dell computer with a flat screen from the year 2005 is doing in the movie, and everything else that are not from 1992. lois lane have also forgot after 5 years that she know that clark is superman, if this wasn't enough she have also given birth to supermans son. another thing that fail is the awkward love thing between the two, everyone remember the first time superman did take lois lane for a fly trip. in the new movie they try to do it again and it is just no magic in it, and you will feel like going to the toilet for a 5 min shitting.i am not gonna say much about the computer animated scenes, since everyone here knows how bad it can go, remember the remake of the older star wars movies?... this new superman movie just got it all. the action scene is nothing you haven't seen before, its not impressive but comical...i am glad that i didn't pay money to watch this pile of Hollywood garbage, its not worth it...",1,2,OpinionGuy,"Jul 9, 2006",

10,Great Movie,"I found this to be a magnificent movie. The acting by Routh, Bosworth, and Marsden was perfect and dead-on. Routh has taken the legend of Superman to new level. I've always been a Reeves fan, but Routh more than holds his own. The movie had great pacing also. The action scene with the plane in the beginning was very special on the special effects. What I really loved about the movie was the artistic moments when Superman would just float for a moment (when he was listening to Earth, soaking up the sun to recharge, etc.). These looked great on the big screen. I've seen the movie twice already and plan on many more viewings.",1,3,tonyperkinson,"Jul 9, 2006",

1,Not the best of movies,"Having watched this movie I feel that it is not nearly as good as previous Superman films. The plot was so thin you could see right through it. The graphics although all good were too much in the dark.It was a waste of Kevin Spaceys time doing this as I still have problems discovering what his role was. With the state of computerised graphics that we have nowadays I would have thought that they would have been a lot better than they were. Maybe I am too old to appreciate this film but being, what I consider, an open minded person I felt that the film was too long and did not keep my interest. It was almost one hour before the actual story started.",3,4,lancealot_sir,"Jul 9, 2006",
1,Awful awful awful -- not for superhero fans...or children,"I love films like LEON, RESERVOIR DOGS and USUAL SUSPECTS, but, in this instance, I was offended by the gangster style violence in a superhero film. The humour was rank and the plot and characters were base (not to mention debase without warrant). The characterization of Lex was less a capitalist megalomaniac and more just a maniac. I thought the film was awful shame to the Superman franchise (including the cartoon series). I'm ashamed that younger fans shouldn't see this film. Visually, boring. Far too long and just too loud with nothing to shout about. Spiderman, x-men, Batman, they're all doing it right. This was just wrong. I left the cinema.",2,3,lizm-4,"Jul 9, 2006",
8,"Good return, with both old and new fans satisfied.","The fact about this awesome Brian Singer movie really reflected the golden ages of Superman in 1970's. So everything, everyone is just like before. Smiling of Clark Kent and Lux Luther's smiling are definitely the same with old ones. Returns just made the closest to the first one,and the first one in 1978 is still the best IMO. We see, a mixed one of new scenes and old scenes together. That is satisfying to both old and new audiences of Superman.All the cast are fine. But no one matches Kevin Spacey. He has done another great job by playing Gene Hackman's role. When you just see the funny face, you may easily mistake him with Hackman. That's remarkable because Gene also acted as Lux Luther at the age of 47 for the first time. Maybe we can also forecast Kevin's third Academy Award in his sixty's. Ha ha!Special effects are also very good. You won't be disappointed by the ""lord of rings-like"" scenes and their details. Superman's muscle seems a little softer than before, but it also shows what director wants to tell us,that is, Superman is also a human. To understand this movie in a more humanity way, you don't have to know any a bit of English. Because Singer's story-telling is better than most of drama films on show. And people laugh at what they are supposed to laugh at, no matter how much they received quotes.If you really want me to tell something not so satisfying, I'd say it's the complex. When everyone is waiting for some kick-ass actions like the old series, they see superman defeats bad guys without facing them. Maybe this is also arranged by our dear director Mr. Singer. Maybe he doesn't want superman to be somebody that wages violence on human flesh......Anyway it's one of the most rewarding big films on screen in 2006.

8,"Even though you were raised as a human being , you are not one of them......","I am not a comic book reader. Not cause I didn't think they were cool, but because movies were just more interesting to me. Movies are my passion, not comic books. OK, introductions made.Superman. He has that name for a reason, 'nuff said. Bryan Singer. Well, you like the guy's work or you don't. I do. X-Men and X-2 were great movies; and Singer worked his charm for Superman Returns.First off, casting. Half of what a director does is cast his picture well. Great cast, Routh blended in seamlessly as the Man of Steel, Kate Bosworth had that feeling like you've seen her somewhere before (i.e. Remember the Titans and Blue Crush) but you couldn't remember where, so she was just Lois Lane to you. Now, Routh as Clark Kent; splendid. We've all been the geek at some point, or the weirdo, or just the outcast; and Clark is just fun to watch. Kevin Spacey, oh my holy god. Funny when its okay to be funny, and ruthless when its great to be ruthless. He fits effortlessly into the role of Lex Luthor, superb actor giving a great performance in a superb role. Casting highlights made, well what else can I say? Everyone else just fit. The cast fit well together, very well.Next, the crew. Cinematography-well played, some very good moments visually that I just can't ruin for you. VFX-Matrix eat your heart out. This is what believable human flight looks like to me. Especially next to a very real looking 777, but thats enough out of me on that one. Sound? Totally enthralling. Very theatrical.Most important - editing and music. John Williams' score is perfectly reused at the critical moments, but John Ottman's music is well worth noting. There are a couple of cues, particularly with Lex Luthor, that stood out just as much to me as Williams' superman march, and thats saying something. Elliot Graham and Ottman do a good job cutting the picture together, too. Not quite as memorable as Michael Ellis and Stuart Baird's cut of the original; but Ottman and Graham place the tension elsewhere rather than everywhere at once. Personally, I think its cut together more intensely than X-2 was, but thats me.Finally - Directing. Bryan Singer in the pilot's seat. Given the majority of films released to the public, less and less is capable of impressing me. Especially in terms of action. Return of the King and Batman Begins really ruined it for most movies, because I loved them and they kept me on edge so long and so well that they set the bar incredibly high. Having said that, Superman Returns impressed me. If this doesn't prove Bryan Singer as a very capable director, there's no hope for Hollywood.Many of those I know are now hyped up for the next summer blockbuster, but I just wanted to take this moment in time to express the impact this movie made on me. It won't change how I look at life, but it impressed me. Its everything you go to the theater for, even if you only see it once, I highly recommend the theater, there's no way home video will have the same feeling. A strong and well executed movie.Superman Returns.",1,1,xxzerowildfirexx,"Jul 9, 2006",
1,Supercrap,"I don't know what it was about this movie... but I found myself wanting to leave earlier than halfway through. I knew what was going to happen (these kinds of movie never surprise you) I thought, foolishly, that Kevin Spacey could make this film worth viewing - and while the best moments are with Luther, the movie overall makes my stomach want to work in reverse. The budget for this film would have been better spent making a sock-puppet movie. Sure, it looked great - and superman gets shot in the eyeball. Cool. But for how long it is, its amazing how little actually happens. Luther and Superman only see each other once for like a 3 minute sequence. Most of the movie is spent making up stupid reasons for Superman to use his powers. Most of the movies happenings' go down in the last half hour it seemed like.

,"A noble effort, but disappointing","It's been almost 20 years since the Man of Steel last saw the silver screen, and 10 of those (as well as a reported $40 million) had been spent trying to get this film off the ground. The project had many different people attached in that time, including Tim Burton, Kevin Smith, McG and Brett Ratner directing, and Nicolas Cage, Brenden Fraser and Ashton Kutcher all rumoured to play the Kryptonian. With all that talent and financial backing in the 10 year development stage, this was set to be the biggest movie of the year.Brett Ratner traded Bryan Singer for directing duties on X-Men: The Last Stand, and Singer went for unknown Brandon Routh to don the cape and tights.Superman Returns is about just that- Superman returning. We start with both Superman and Clark Kent returning from a five year absence (why no one put two and two together, I'll never know) to a world that has radically changed, and Superman now ponders if he should have even come back. The love of his life, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is now engaged and has a young child. Kent is barely able to get his job back at the Daily Planet, and, oh by the way, Lane won the Pulitzer for writing an article entitled ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" Of course trusty old Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been freed from jail, thanks to the absence of Superman at his appeals trial, and is up to his old tricks, only this time with the very same technology that Superman had been sent to Earth with from Krypton, which Luthor had stolen from the Fortress of Solitude.Superman has never been a multi-layered superhero. He never had the brooding angst which made Batman such an interesting hero. Superman had all the powers that could make him perfect. He invincible to everything except a rare metal that very few even knew existed. And he stood for truth, justice and the American way. Very one dimensional. And what broke down here was that they tried to infuse internal dilemmas into a story that never really had any. Warner Brothers wanted another Batman Begins without realizing that Superman is NOT Batman. And the story suffered for it.It also lacked the charm of the original film series. It fell victim to the 21st century and was too much action, not enough substance. All glitz and no glamour. The true appeal of Superman, at least for me, is concocting somewhat interesting stories out of this flat character. And I for one was not interested. The principal cast is where it really begins to break apart. Brandon Routh makes a fine Superman, but just wasn't there for Clark Kent. I didn't buy him. He was almost too good looking to be believable as a lovable dorky reporter and a handsome superhero. Christopher Reeve was just perfect for it.I really can't say enough negative things about Kate Bosworth. I've never been too fond of her in the first place, but Lois Lane is just as iconic as Superman, so she had some mighty big shoes to fill. And she didn't. When I was watching her, I felt like I was watching a bad imitation of all the Lois Lanes in the past, rather than watching Lois Lane. She lacked that inner spunk and naivety which made both Margot Kidder and Teri Hatcher shine in the role. And the thing is, Singer came oh so close to casting the right person. But instead of putting Parker Posey in as Lois Lane, she had squander her talent in the equally alliterative, yet less important role of Kitty Kowalski, Luthor's female henchman.But wouldn't you know it, Kevin Spacey really came from left field and played a perfect Lex Luthor. And I think he did it right. He acknowledged Gene Hackman's interpretation, but brought his own style to it, and played it a bit darker, a bit more megalomaniacal than Hackman's. And he stands as the saving grace of the film.Singer should have stuck with the X-Men franchise. I don't blame him for leaving it for his dream project, how often does that get dropped into your lap. But he was better there, and I think he had more to work with, and less pressure to deal with. Superman was just too big for him.He also faulted when it came to the construction of the film. He relied way too much on digital effects, what I dub the George Lucas trap. Plenty could have been done with set pieces and creative stunt work. But he opted to trust all that to a computer, and in the end he blurred the line between real-life and animation (pay attention to Superman's face, it's too perfect at times).It accomplishes being a fun, entertaining film. But I have a feeling that that's really not what they were aiming for. And since both the filmmaker's intentions and the audience's expectations were not met, it is ultimately and unfortunately a failure.",3,3,BrodieMann,"Jul 9, 2006",
1,Not The Superhero Experience Of The Summer...Returns Falls and Fails,"Superman Returns is a rabid trip through the dull and boring, keeping your hopes up and letting them drop quickly. While the movie does sport a few good scenes or at least one. The movie is stretched out to the death, way to long and very unnecessary scenes put into play to fill in gaps. Little to no character development, no cut loose scenes, boring dialouge, unintreaguing storyline, and with the exception of the actress of Lois Lane a bad cast.This summer acclaimed movie really disappointed movie Byran Singer should have stuck to the X-Men series and it's sad sales reflect the movie itself. It had petonital but sadly it was unused this movie trys to match Batman Begins but fails. Bryan Singer attempts to adopt a new style but falls faster than the movie itself. Nothing more than a lost petonital blockbuster. If you are looking for the true superhero experience check out X-Men 3: The Last Stand, holding on to the superhero movie of the summer.While Superman Returns may have faired decently in the reviews for reasons unknown, it is not the superhero movie of the summer. And drags on quite a bit the beginning is slow, the end and the climax is more of a low point in the film. Unless your a die hard Superman fan I suggest you pass on the 10 dollar addmision fee and put it to one of the better movies of the summer X-Men 3 or Pirates of the Caribbean 2.Superman Returns if must seen in your eyes is a movie you can wait for DVD release this I promise you.",4,3,Twenty_East,"Jul 9, 2006",

It wasn't a terrible movie but it wasn't that good either.I was a comic book reader when I was a kid and tend to like the well done adaptations but much like the hulk, daredevil and fantastic four this movie was WAY more cheesy than expected and had less action than I had expected.

He may not be like Gene Hackman, but he put a nice spin on that part and I chuckled through some of it.A slight drawback is that the film is almost three hours, and that could make it ""boring"" to some folks, but it seemed to hold its own in spite of that.

When the opening credits rolled and the John Williams score began, I felt like I was sitting in the theater back in '78 getting ready to see Superman again for the first time.This is an excellent movie, an obvious tribute to Reeve and co. but establishing the new faces at the same time. I thought Routh was great as Superman ( in fact, in a couple of scenes better than Reeve ). The effects were amazing but it's the story, the dialogue, etc. that in time will make this the new standard for Superman.There's not many movies that make me want to personally thank the people involved, but this one did.

3,If you only see this Superman maybe it's okay maybe,"This struck me as an odd quasi sequel mostly remake--though now without any of the actors from the first film. It rests so heavily on that film and ignores the mostly ignore worth sequels, that I can't imagine it working at all without seeing that first film, which maybe lots of the people who seem to like it have. But it just seemed odd to me, only Spacey as the villain did anything new, or was allowed to and scripted in a way that let him do something different, and the look of the film is all over the place with the actors mostly looking like they are made out of plastic wrap you'd put on frozen food and the colors being kind of muted. It has a muddy look because it's not shot on film folks.The films peaks about 20 minutes before it's over and has not much of an ending really, much of the editing seems random (the film was still being editing right up the last minute and feels like a rush job--certain things go on too long other things don't develop properly. Just kind of a big overlong mess. Not really enough new going on here to justify its existence, and what was the MOONRAKER space shuttle sequence doing in this film? And what are all those lines borrowed from the original film doing mixed in with an occasionally new story in a way that they don't make sense, to say nothing of the Marlon Brando footage being reused and the odd dedication to dead husband and wife Mr. and Mrs. Reeve who the filmmakers must be glad aren't around to bad mouth their feeble efforts to disguise this as new film-it's a rehash done rather poorly.",2,1,HEFILM,"Jul 9, 2006",

It was hard to see where the gigantic budget went...the special effects looked like well..special effects. It made me realize how good the original cast were, Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty and the others supporting cast. The cast of Superman Returns are pale imitations compared to the originals, even Kevin Spacey who had the juicyest role didn't deliver. The plot was so-so and I can only lay the blame with the director who seemed unable to get the best out of the actors he cast.

All of the scenes were beautifully choreographed and I must say Brandon Routh looked beautiful in all of them.I also have to give credit to Kevin Spacey, his great acting skills really gave a delightful sprinkle and taste to the film.

No picture is ever perfect. But Superman Returns comes close! I consider it to be a better picture than the first Superman movie and that is saying a lot as Christopher Reeve had no equal then. However Brandon Routh is definitely his equal in his performance in this latest installment of the Superman legend. This was a stirring, thoughtful and engaging film from start to finish. It contained a great many layers to the overall story. I particularly enjoyed the 'inner' look at Superman - beyond his great powers and how he might feel and think. A class act of a movie, spectacular, thought provoking, sometimes a little over the top, but always, always engaging, entertaining and exciting. Don't listen to anyone who says differently. See this movie and sit back and enjoy a little over two hours of movie magic, simply stunning special effects, brilliant acting from the entire cast - particularly Brandon. This guy will go far!! Loved Superman Returns! Will go see it again!",1,2,hamilton53,"Jul 10, 2006",
7,Excellent film BUT...,"Singer delivers again a great film - establishing himself as one of the best directors today. The movie is visually stunning probably surpassing even the visual effects of the 2 spiderman movies. The cast is also brilliant - highlights being Routh and Spacey, both bring in mind Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman - with Spacey making Luthor a bit darker and more of a psycho, he probably even surpasses Hackman's performance.Moreover, the effects are -as above-mentioned- brilliant giving at last a movie that shows all of superman's strengths (unlike the old movies that could not include everything). ""Returns"" is a big homage to the 2 original movies - from the credits, to J.WIlliam's theme, Clark Kent's old fashioned expressions, the closing scene and actually all of the movie...Singer's (and his editor) construct a very well-structured, nicely paced (perhaps a bit slower than expected) movie that you do not feel its as long as it is (2,5 hours), although some flashback-Krypton-scenes that we expected to see (from some teaser posters) were absent, which could have been included...Except from a a bit of minor flaws that could have been eradicated it the cutting room, another minor flaw that actually is probably not the movie's fault but of the marketing campaign of it: the hype and expectations of the movie were high and as a Super-geek that I am I saw every trailer and TV spot prior to seeing the movie (more than 10) and this spoiled the experience - all the ""WOW"" scenes did not wow me... I really hope that production companies stop doing such a mixed up job on promoting movies... Lower your expectations and do not see more than one trailer - and you will be blown away by the movie...In addition, I believe that in a few years this will be remembered as the ultimate Superman movie and as a better cinematic example than the original Superman movies... Which were not as good as this - having the burden of bad structures, and a lot of people messing up with the director's vision whereas here Singer does not compromise his vision at all... The old Supeman movies will remain as nostalgic landmarks of what the movies can offer and the fact that they came in a time (1978) where movies were still learning what special effects were and still a lot of potential was not yet fulfilled...For now ""Returns"" is rated with a solid 8 and I believe that with subsequent viewings it will come closer to a 10...

The movie looks great and sounds great, and hell, even the acting is decent. But there's just one thing, there is no intrigue about the character, no attachment to him other than the fact he is the good and moral model citizen, making for a more empty movie than the likes of Batman, V for Vendetta or to a lesser extent Spider-man. Now don't get me wrong, its not a bad movie, but I don't think it will be one that a large audience will want to see again and again. I still think people should see it and enjoy it, but I think it will just be another Summer blockbuster.Like one of my good friends said, the movie was pretty well done, the action was kinda cool...but there's no possible way to be impressed or surprised by anything he does, thus taking away a lot of the fun one finds in these type movies!",1,1,teddy_34,"Jul 10, 2006",

5,Identity Crisis,"He is the Man of Steel, the native son of Krypton, and the savior of humanity. He is Superman, and he has returned...Kind of. Superman Returns is the latest Superman flick starring Brandon Routh, Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth and it's been a while since the last Superman encounter which most are quick to forget. However, due to the enormous success of the X-Men and Spiderman movies as well as Batman Begins, we all knew it was a given that another Superman movie was on it's way. The only question is, just how much punch does this new Man of Steel pack? I'm going to start by going out on a limb and say that the first hour or so of the movie was not paced well or all that well put together. Unless you're a huge Superman nerd, you won't be able to help the fact that you're having trouble putting two and two together. Of course, all the Superman back story is eventually explained, but you'll have to wait a while to get it all. Too often at the beginning of the movie, the scene switches between Lex Luther (Spacey) and the returning Clark Kent (Routh). Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but it disrupted some of the flow that would have helped the movie establish itself more earlier.Perhaps the biggest problem with Superman Returns appears to be a case of identity crisis. This movie has a lot of trouble deciding what it wants to be. It shows flashes of brilliance in action and adventure but there's too much focus on the love square that has formed between Kent, Superman, Lois Lane (Bosworth) and her ""fiancee"" Richard White (played by James Marsden, most recognizable as Cyclops from the X-Men movies). However, any hope the movie has of being more of a drama is broken up by hilarious dialogue.Strangely enough though, this hodge podge of movie genres works rather well when it needs to. The action scenes are breathtaking, and the comedy element doesn't feel out of place. Bosworth and Routh work well together and Spacey plays Lex Luther as well as anyone could hope to. Superman Returns does a lot of things right, but considering how much better it could have been, it's a little disappointing. Returns is worth the price of admission and possibly a DVD purchase, but little else. The movie just suffers from too many little things.",2,0,DoomSong8,"Jul 10, 2006",
10,Excellent movie,"I think this is one of the summer's best movies. It's a little slow at the beginning but doesn't come across as 'overdone'. It's definitely a worthy successor. Brandon Routh fills a very large pair of boots with aplomb and at times I wondered if they were showing footage of him or of Christopher Reeve their mannerisms and such were so similar. I know that some reviewers have referred to Kate Bosworth's performance as Lois Lane as rather dull, but personally as much as I liked the original Superman movie, I found Margot Kidder's Lois Lane so driven as to be almost obnoxious. Ms Bosworth's portrayal seemed more... realistic. If that's the right word. And Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, he's definitely one of my favorite actors ever, he's so talented. I recommend seeing it, go expecting to entertained and you will not be disappointed. I would go see it again in a heartbeat, and that's not something I say about a lot of movies, not with ticket prices being what they are!",1,2,minniyar,"Jul 10, 2006",
6,It's OK,"I can sum this movie up in just three words: Lois Lane Returns. I don't care how they change the story or about parts of the story that don't really jive with Superman's history. The only thing I care about is that when I go see something called Superman Returns I would actually like to see just that. There is way, way, way too much Lois Lane. There could not have been a worse choice than Kate Bosworth to play this part. Let's hope that Bryan Singer can deliver more Superman in the next film and less everything else. I don't mind the other characters, but they need to stay secondary where they are supposed to be. Just part of the scenery. At the end of this movie I was laughing because it just would not end.",0,3,stuprum,"Jul 10, 2006",

4,Pompous ... Pretentious ... Boring,"Superman Returns may be the most pompous and pretentious movie ever made in the history of cinema. Treating a comic-book character like he's Lawrence of Arabia or a virtual deity is ludicrous. Regarding the deity angle, let's not forget that no spirit or deity invested Superman with super powers. Rather Superman's super powers are the result of him being on a planet with a physical make up entirely different from the planet where he originated. Also, the acting in this movie is, like the movie itself, uninspiring and dull. Superman Returns contains what has to be the worst performance in Frank Langella's career. This is the first movie where the character Perry White is portrayed as being subdued and pensive, and a subdued and pensive Perry White is exactly what this movie could do without. Nobody in this movie is particularly exciting. Is this because of the director? Or the actors? Or the script? Who knows. Probably a combination of all three. But one thing is certain, if you decide to go watch this movie, don't forget to bring a pillow in case you doze off. Or better yet, bring a Superman comic book.",1,4,PWNYCNY,"Jul 10, 2006",
8,"""Superman"" returns with a bang, and a few problems.","Superman returns to the big screen with flashing colors and multi-million dollar special effects. In ""Superman Returns"", Brandon Routh fills the large shoes of Superman/ Clark Kent, and he does so well, although not as well as the late Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey takes on the notorious role of Lex Luthor, made famous by the legendary Gene Hackman. In the beginning, Superman returns to Earth from being in space for six years, investigating whether he is really the last of the Kryptons. When he finally returns, he finds that Lois Lane, the love of his life, has moved on and now has a fiancé and a son. Lex Luthor, Superman's old nemesis has devised a mastermind plan to wipe out most of the United States to create his own new continent with a crystal that came from Superman's home planet Kyripton. Superman must figure out a way to stop Lex Luthor, and at the same time win the heart of Lois Lane. Neither of these are an easy task...even for Superman. The movie as a whole is very entertaining. The movie seems to rely more on the visuals than on the drama, considering Superman gets very few speaking lines. I was a little disappointed about the lack of fighting scenes between Superman and villains. There was plenty of flying around in the clouds, but very little, if not no combat. There was really only one scene that brought the movie past the PG realm and into PG-13. Also the movie was a little bit longer than necessary, with a running time of over 2 and a half hours. The movie had it's moments, but there were a few that didn't seem needed in the final cut. It's very interesting to see an updated version of the world of Superman with state-of-the-art special effects, however it has some flaws like the above and also the poor casting and directing of Lois Lane, who brought pretty much nothing to the table above standing around. Don't get the wrong idea though. It is still a very good movie, but it's not by any means perfect. Even so, Superman will always marvel the audience.

He doesn't plan on sticking' around, paying' child support or nothing'. He basically was happy the entire movie. Did he even hit anybody. He was too happy sucking in the media attention.

Well done on a great escape from the day to day reality of a world that could use a Superman to fight for truth, justice and the ""International"" way.

Yeah, she seems like a Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist with a five-year-old. When did she have the kid -- when she was 12? And speaking of the kid - he needs a new agent. Give him some lines, for the love of Pete. Why hire Eva Marie Saint and then WASTE HER?! And tone down the violence. FOr a movie that is aimed at kids (at least I felt most of the script was very much aimed at kids) some of the violence in the latter part of the movie is way too graphic and unnecessary.Effects -- okay.Music -- I have to say, that Superman main theme is so fabulous. Stirring, upbeat, and lovely.Symbolism -- Oy vey! What was this, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Supes?!"" Here's a helpful note for the director -- they spell it ""Symbol"" as opposed to ""Cymbal"" because it shouldn't ring in your ears like a clanging, clashing blast of cymbals.If you must, rent it on DVD.

7,A good return to the big screen.,"For chronological reasons in- and outside of the movie itself, ""Superman Returns"" is a unique sequel. This is not ""Batman Begins"", which ignored all previous incarnations and essentially started anew; nor is it ""X2"", which follows on the heels of the original; nor is it one of the first three ""Batman"" sequels, all of which trailed the 1989 version by an undefined but irrelevant period of time. Director Bryan Singer's film occurs five years after ""Superman II"", under the (wistful) pretenses that the third and fourth installments of the series never happened. Additionally the two predecessors that ""Returns"" does follow were released over a quarter century ago, so largely (and sadly) unknown to much of today's audience. Therefore the franchise is simultaneously continued and reinvented, a strange dichotomy upon which ""Returns"" finds both its strongest and weakest moments.Often a movie succeeds in telling its story well but falls short in the little areas that can push it several levels higher. The first two ""Harry Potter"" movies, for example, tell the books' stories and portray the universe effectively, but lack the character and cinematic touches that Alfonso Cuaron so brilliantly infused into ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". ""Superman Returns"" accomplishes the opposite, nailing the little things but sometimes missing the overall target. Writer/director Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"", ""X-Men"") and company clearly understand the Superman mythos established by previous incarnations of the hero. They wisely choose to borrow John Williams' original theme, imitate the original credits, and include plenty lines that refer to the first two films. Some lines are quoted directly (Superman's comment about the safety of flying), while other words reinforce previously established traits (like Lois' inability to spell). This attention to detail leaves fans of those movies with a sweet taste on their cinematic tongues, but one that may be indistinguishable to ignorant viewers.Brandon Routh's performance as the Man of Steel does likewise. He enthralls with an eerie ability to channel Christopher Reeve's presence, physical and vocal mannerisms, and charming clumsiness. Whether this is a testament to Routh's mimicry skills or to how well Reeve defined the role is debatable, but either way Routh deserves praise for filling the part well, as does Singer for casting an unknown, a fact that may have helped Routh match Superman's alien status. These components supply the high points of the film, as ""Returns"" captures the all-important mystique of Superman that was present in ""I"" and ""II"".The same cannot be said of many of the movie's choices, which lack the cohesion of a great film. Kevin Spacey provides a microcosm of the problem. Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor with a perfect concoction of darkness and comedy. Evil tinged his humor and humor tinged his evil. Spacey's Luthor possesses both qualities, but at disparate times, creating a distracting bipolar antagonist out of a single-minded villain. I'm not a big fan of Kate Bosworth's turn either. She embodies the hard-nosed journalist side of Lois Lane well, but her human side appears too intentionally cynical and invulnerable. Admittedly though, Lois should have changed over the missing five years, so perhaps I merely long for Margot Kidder's fantastic work. Bosworth tries hard, but never looks quite right or finds the balance of Lois as investigator and love interest.This thread of inconsistency snakes through the entire movie, even into the overall storyline, which is fairly standard superhero stuff: Superman...uh..returns to a retro-futuristic Metropolis, where he must confront his past with Lois while dealing with Luthor's nefarious schemes. That much is fine, but an anticipatory undercurrent flows beneath the waves. Singer was successful with the X-Men franchise in part because he told the story and did not over-emphasize the underlying built-in analogies of the mutants. Here he inserts a discordant arc that, as it surfaces, convolutes and stretches a simple story with twisted aspirations to a greater or more complex level of cinema. A noble effort, and one that may be more appreciated in the long run, but for now falls flat.Despite these flaws, ""Superman Returns"" is still an excellent movie experience, a fact that speaks to the nonpareil power of the Superman mythos. The movie's overwhelming Superman-ness saves it much like Superman looks to save humanity. He exhibits relatable characteristics taken from every other recent silver screen star: the outsider nature of the X-Men, the awkward everyman side of Peter Parker, Batman's seeming infallible desire to eliminate crime. Superman is good and uncomplicated. He stands for truth, justice, and the American way; he awkwardly seeks acceptance; he scarcely harms anyone; he grew up on an idyllic farm in Kansas. He is Norman Rockwell's superhero. Singer seems to understand this, doling out the full iconic treatment through classic framing, sweeping camera movement, and the aforementioned cinematic touches. The only misstep is in the overly dramatic tone of this deification, which drifts to the serious side. The original has a twinkle-in-the-eye attitude, one that winks at the silliness of a man in tights, one that is more uplifting in many respects, such as the way it conveys the joy of flying. ""Returns"" utilizes slightly too heavy a hand, failing to fully communicate the exhilarating experience, but definitely succeeding in portraying the grandness of Superman. In the superhero universe, I have long been a Batman guy, and I still am, but this movie reiterates what many already know: Superman is the best. End of discussion.Just as ""Superman Returns"" as a whole is a dynamic paradox of past, present, and future, many of its parts are a series of contradictions that do not completely find a proper middle ground. Although very entertaining, the end result does not strike as deep as it could have, leaving the viewer with a pleasant saccharine sensation that masks a lingering bitter aftertaste.Bottom Line: ""Superman Returns"" is magnetically appealing, a welcome adventure back into the world of Superman, one that ought to be seen on the big screen. 7 of 10.",1,1,Pavel-8,"Jul 11, 2006",
7,"Thoroughly entertaining, but not without problems","Bryan Singer established himself as the premiere visionary for comic book based movies with his take on the X-Men in the first two films. With Superman Returns, he changes the dynamics of his comic book perception, which becomes both a good and bad thing.Superman Returns continues the flow of the Richard Donner line of films, continuing from where Superman II left off. But, instead of focusing on nothing but action, Superman Returns focuses on the relationship between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane and how sometimes the most painful thing to an invulnerable creature is that which tears at its heart. In this aspect, Superman Returns is a refreshing view of comic book sensibilities, exposing a great deal of depth that is usually overlooked when translating comic characters to the big screen.The drawback to all the added focus to the emotional side of the story is that the action scenes play out almost dutifully with a major lack of sensibility. The action scenes seem almost used only to move the story along rather than being critical to the overall picture. In fact, after several weeks I can barely remember much about the action scenes whereas the human interaction scenes I can recall with great detail. As well, there are some major leaps in logic in how the final action scene plays out, making it almost disappointing.The other major drawback is in trying to update the film to modern times without putting enough thought into context. While Perry White talks about ""truth, justice and all that other stuff"" (more on that gaffe later) in a modernized newspaper environment, the notion that any newspaper in modern times would have as much gleam and glisten as this film's Daily Planet has is beyond credible. With televisions hanging from every other support column in the Daily Planet office, one must question why the screenwriters would choose to update the minor stuff like famous catchphrases while ignoring the obvious fact that in modern times the Daily Planet of the stature we see in this film would more likely be a cable news station than a newspaper. In this, some of the updates just simply don't make sense compared to things left untouched.There has been much criticism leveled at the film for its abandonment of the classic catchphrase, ""truth, justice and the American way."" The screenwriters' response was tepid at best in suggesting that the reasoning had to do with Superman being an international hero and that the ""American way"" has a different modern meaning that might not sit with some. I'm a Canadian, so it's not like that really affected me on a patriotic level. But, there is obviously more to it than what the writers allude to in that when Lex Luthor talked about fire being stolen from the Gods and given to humanity in the form of technology, saying roads gave the Romans power and ships gave Britain its power, they ignored the flow that would yield American power based on airplanes or the space program in favor of mentioning the atom bomb. Obviously, the screenwriters felt that focusing on anything nice in particular about America would be a bad thing.It is unfortunate that the screenwriters and Bryan Singer were embarrassed enough of their heritage and politically obsessed enough that they had to force a political issue when it never would have arisen otherwise, as -- like a fart in a taxi cab -- it became a big, useless distraction in both enjoyment and discussion of this film. This could be the perfect example of how sometimes screenwriters should learn to leave well enough alone and realize that taking the smallest things too seriously can ruin things for their intended audience. Not everybody is as obsessed over every element in their lives being about political considerations, so to make such a major change (let's face it... changing a slogan is a BIG change) for such a minor reason just leaves a bad taste.Considering the underwhelming box-office take of Superman Returns thus far ($140 million domestically against a $250-$300 million budget), these may be some lessons to be heeded in the future. Overall, Superman Returns is a fun film to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously. Compared to Bryan Singer's X-Men films, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films or Christopher Nolan's take on the Dark Knight in Batman Begins, it doesn't really stand up. But as a film you can kick back and enjoy, it certainly fills that need.",0,0,Surecure,"Jul 11, 2006",

Kevin Spacey is amazing as the bald Lex Luther. He truly knows how to capture the evil & sinister character. Parker Posey is Lex's sidekick as Kitty. She seems to be in with his evil plan for the money but has a side of compassion that Posey is really good at expressing.There are some really great parts of Superman Returns that emphasize the importance of heroes.

6,boringly safe,"I saw Superman Returns this afternoon. Boringly safe. That's how Singer played it. Continued where the 70/80's movies left off. With a Superman/Clark Kent that looks a lot like Christopher Reeve. But less in this case would have been more. Now, I kept comparing. I've never felt myself doing that during 'Lois & Clark', with Dean Cain. And Brandon Routh looks younger than Christopher Reeve in his first Superman movie. Couldn't the producers find an actor in his mid-thirties? I liked Reeve's performance better - here, you feel like Routh wants to fill somebody else's shoes and boots, instead of playing the part(s) like he wants to. And is it me, or was there any chemistry between Lois and Clark at all? I didn't sense it anyway. Not like between Terri Hatcher and Dean Cain; or Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. Kate Bosworth is very pretty, but lacked the spunk, the zest of the other two. Maybe having a son does that to an intrepid female reporter? Kevin Spacey was very good, although they gave him a second hand plot to work with. And I must say I understood Gene Hackman's diabolic plan, but here, it's kind of convoluted. Besides, the comic, Lois & Clark and Smallville have redefined Luthor: he's a shrewd business man. Not some kind of megalomanic con artist. Kitty whatshername: miss Teschmacher with black hair. Dumb, and compassionate. Instead of making her a character that made Lex Luthor look like a choirboy. Good thing about the movie: Superman has a son. Hopefully, we're in for a more interesting sequel. The special effects are great. But that's hardly a surprise in this day and age, is it? Very much appreciated: they kept the Superman theme.

1,"Superman III, Part 2: An Argument Against ""Superman Returns""","If fellow IMDb voters are basing their rave reviews of ""Superman Returns"" on the mere fact that it's better than the FIRST attempt at a Superman III (the one with Richard Pyror, remember?), then indeed this movie is superb; make that FANTASTIC: the greatest, most fulfilling superhero movie to date. However, to my monumental disappointment, it isn't. At over 150 minutes, we are offered nothing new in comparison to the previous installments besides a longer running time. No new ground is covered that wasn't already four times before. Lex Luthor is STILL the bad guy, while the diverse Superman rogue gallery (Bizarro, Braniac, Metallo, Darkseid, and Doomsday to name a few) remains completely untouched. Did the producers of ""Superman Returns"" not realize that this formula had been all tapped out by parts 3 and 4? This film proves that the solution for making up for Supermans III and IV is NOT to pretend as if they never existed, but to start a new franchise.""Superman Returns"" is religiously devoted to the Donner-Superman, so much so that it copies it. For some inexplicable reason, it attempts to pick-up the story from Superman II and worse, resurrect Marlon Brando's famous ""lost footage"". It also manages to mangle any chances of a decent sequel by giving Superman a kid, something so cheap and opportunistic that even DC Comics hasn't thought of it. But what's missing from this devout mistake is the irreplaceable presence of Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. This movie is so badly miscast in its two leads that you could say this Superman III has TWO Gus Gormans instead of one. Make that two Nuclear Men: Brandon Routh is completely without presence, an emotionally challenged amateur. While Kidder's Lois Lane was sassy, Kate Bosworth has no character to work with. Lois is as lifeless as Superman, not that she is absolved of any guilt: Bosworth herself proves she is talented only at gracing CVS make-up displays, furthuring the notion that dating Orlando Bloom is part of a resume. Given her performance in this film, I'm inclined to say it is her best part yet. And one has to feel sorry for poor Kevin Spacey, who's given the unfortunate task of playing a rich villain like Lex Luthor with the one-notedness that Singer's writers give him. Spacey plays Luthor so over the top that you begin to appreciate how, even in the midst of such cinematic bile as ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"", Gene Hackman towed the line between humor and chutzpah. As for the Luthor character himself, why do the films insist on making him the sole villain time and time again? Why always make him a jester obsessed with real estate? These were FAULTS of the earlier films, not strengths. If you're unfamiliar with these criticisms, then look no further than the ""Man of Steel"" comic (or even Smallville for that matter) from 1986 and you'll see what I mean. Lex Luthor's comics persona is so much more interesting that it truly is a shame that Singer refuses to give him these pernicious touches and instead prefers a lightweight caricature. Why does this film not start from the beginning and start anew? What is the purpose of making Superman Returns a sequel, besides causing confusion in some viewers and to remind others of how much this film pales in comparison to Superman's I and II. After something as fulfilling and as involving as ""Batman Begins"", how can anyone find this good? I suspect that part of the basis for a positive review is 50% based on the mere fact that Superman is on screen and you're alive to sit down and watch him in a theater. In that case, you will love this movie. Or if you're looking for a ""Beyond the Sea"" reunion, then you also might like this movie. Otherwise there doesn't seem to be a legitimate reason to. Bryan Singer, who made two great movies out of the X-Men comic books, fails at Superman because he offers no new interpretation of it. You'll derive more entertainment from a John Byrne comic, because truthfully, there's more life in the ink version of Superman then there is in this entire 154-minute chore of a movie. Superman does indeed return, but with nothing to offer but a rehash of the more lively Christopher Reeve films.",15,14,Sccrream97-1,"Jul 11, 2006",

Although it's two and a half hours long, it never got boring. From beginning to end, I was completely captivated by a well written story, and the special effects that were exceptional. The scene on the airplane deserves your undivided attention because I found it very intense and especially amusing after I thought about it for a while.",1,1,BobJo,"Jul 11, 2006",

After more than a decade of development hell, the project finally got off the ground and took flight. As i heard the news of this, i was in usual disbelief, but not only was it real it was unreal that Bryan Singer was taking the helm of the man of steel, now you know that the movie was in good hands if his name is attached! Sitting in the theater I couldn't help but smile through the whole movie, it was a pretty long smile! Brandon Routh was fantastic, he surpassed my expectations, Kevin Spacey added just what Lex Luthor lacked in the original films and of course my hometown Sydney Australia acted as the backdrop for Metropolis.

Imagine there is a great superhero movie with a calm speed, a straight story and a perfect casting. Voila - you've found Superman returns! Great action and simply a great cast of actors. Bryan Singer did simply everything right! Shame it's not THAT successful - especially compared to the dull PIRATES sequel (but that's another story).

5,Why??,"I saw Superman Returns opening weekend. I thought that the action was really well done, and that the characters were some what well developed. There was only one thing i really had a problem with that i will not discuss because it can be classified as a spoiler. Lets just say that a certain portion of the film was sprung on the viewing audience and made us think about where the hell they got this information from. Other then that ""minor"" detail the movie was enjoyable and the tribute to Christopher Reeves was done really well. I also liked the fact that they used the same music and the same credit style in the beginning of the film which was well intended i believe to convey a sense of continuation from the original films to transit into this one. I think that a sequel might be in order, since I'm pretty sure lots of people might be tired of seeing Lex Luther on the screen, maybe they should try Braniac?",0,1,buckbeak1988,"Jul 12, 2006",
8,Better than films no. 3 and 4 at least !!,"I was surprised to see that they were gonna remake Superman, I didn't think it was time. But then this Superman returns theme kicked in (well, I read more about it and found out) and I bought it. I thought it was a little bit odd, but okay. However, I was more surprised by the rave reviews it seemed to get instantly from many critics, and I am comparing this for example to X-Men: The Last Stand... since Bryan Singer departed from X-men to do Superman. I found X-Men 3 to be a much more fun picture than Superman Returns. I think the X-Men trilogy is a great one, and I believe the Superman franchise is great as well. But I didn't have many expectations for this movie and I wasn't completely disappointed, but I wanted more. Brandon Routh is awesome in his dual role and striking resemblance to Christopher Reeve, but since I started comparing and thinking about the four other Superman movies, I cannot help to think that Bosworth was okay as Lois but I liked Kidder better, Spacey is funny and good as Luthor but I liked Hackman better, other familiar figures were equally fun, but the storyline to pictures no. 1 and 2 is much better than in Superman Returns.I am not gonna write details about the storyline, because that would give up too much. But the climax and ending for me were a bit disappointing for me. The possibility of a sequel is there, no problem, but will it be done? It is hard to improve a great score by John Williams, and it is certainly not done here. The cinematography though is great and the new costume looks cool. Special effects naturally better (one wonders how they managed to have the fourth movie with such bad effects!) and well ... quite honestly: the film looked really really good.In the end, you gotta give credit to all people involved (Singer and the actors and all the crew...) for reviving this series. Out of the five movies this one is strongly no. 3, with the original being no. 1 and the second one no. 2. I had fun despite I thought it was lacking in some ways.

10,Thank you Brian Singer!,"I may ramble on here but heres my take on Superman Returns.I am a 38 year old male, married with three children. In 1978 I pestered my parents to take me to see 'Superman The Movie'. Over about a twelve month period I had seen Star Wars, Grease and a couple of other fliks I can't really remember. I was about ten years old at the time and I wasn't a real comic book fan. I remember watching Superman the Movie had a profound effect on me which stays with me to this day. I can't really say what it was but I just loved that movie. I moved towns not long after and a few years down the line Superman II was released. I was old enough now to visit the local cinema on my own and must have viewed both Superman II and Empire Strikes Back numerous times (staying in the toilets between showings). Up until my mid-teens I had a poster of Christopher Reeve on my bedroom wall, the head shot smile, sort of looking back. I went to see Superman III and IV and did enjoy them but I always remember reading a newspaper or mag that said Reeve cried when he saw what they did with IV and I agreed. When it was announced Singer and Warners had agreed I was like a man walking over hot coals. My wife has suffered me since the teaser trailer came out around Xmas time. My kids think I'm just 'plain ol' crazy' I think, but suffer it.Now the history is out of the way here we go.Routh...Masterful choice. I loved Reeve as Superman and I guess a lot of my generation will always think of him as 'the' Superman. My wife sat there (shes ten years my junior) and I had tears in my eyes when Routh entered that plane and asked Lois 'Are you OK?' my wife nudged me as though to ask 'What the f~~?'. 'The f~~' was the fact I had waited twenty years for this moment. I thought Routh was everything I hoped he would be. I loved him as Superman and I thought he played Clark better than Reeve. I loved the superlistening bits and xray sight thru things to look at the women he loves. I WOULD DO IT! A lot of people say 'he looks and acts to much like Reeve', these are the same people who are saying 'there is only one Superman - Reeve'. If any one of us had met Routh and were casting this flik - THEY WOULD HAVE CAST HIM. Last line on Routh - loved you Brandon...You are this generations Clark and Superman. Fantastic Performance all round!!!!!!Bosworth...Nice. OK, all the crap going round - 'She's too young' to play Lois and the rest of the crap. I thought she played it well. It was never going to be easy for any of the cast and crew on Returns. She looked so much better with the dark hair it was unbelievable. Great choice simply because Singer and Warners know there is at least a good couple of sequels here between Routh and Bosworth. The scene on the plane where Lois sees Superman flash past the window for the first time in years was brilliant.Spacey...When announced - I knew he would deliver and he did. I always thought Hackman was just a bit too camp at times and ultimately a bit unbelievable as a threat. Spacey delivers the Lex I wanted. When his thugs are beating the crap out of Superman the look in his eye is awesome.Singer...Thanks. I have waited for this for so long and you didn't disappoint. As I said, I am not a comic book fan, I am a fan of the Superman movies and Singer has presented a heart felt production that carries on what I felt for those films. I just knew from the off when the Warners logo and music started and he added the Superman touch it was going to be something special.Flik...I loved it. Routh totally owned his roles. Bosworth was convincing. Spacey WAS Lex. Supporting cast did a great job. I felt the story continued on from Superman II well. I agree with the way Singer went. He could have totally revamped it but didn't. When you look back now at Supes I & II, especially II they look really dated. The way Singer has weaved his magic on this is to take the best elements of the first two fliks and reinvent them in a way but adding his own touch. I really enjoyed this to the point of tears and if it was twice as long I would have been happy. I always wished that they would almost 'remake' the first two fliks with todays advancements and I felt Singer and crew achieved this with Returns. I went with real expectation and just sat there and was blown away. My Superman has Returned!",1,2,thickasyourwrist,"Jul 12, 2006",
1,:( Very disappointed!!!,I watched this film last night at work (cinema) and i thought it was garbage. It was too long and drawn out for what actually happened. Lex Luthor could have been more evil as to be honest there wasn't really a clear divide between good and evil after all its based on a comic so the divide is important. The concept of superman having a child is beyond reason as his sperm would most likely shoot through Lois like a bullet. yes yes yes i know he was changed into a mortal in Superman 2 and slept with Lois but if this child was his then he wouldn't have super powers that we see touched upon in the film. He was mortal therefore would pass on his mortal self!,10,10,oceanavenue21,"Jul 12, 2006",
10,I Loved This Movie!,"I'm a big fan of superhero movies. I really loved Batman Begins last summer. I've enjoyed the Spider Man movies, and I thought Brian Singer did a wonderful job with the first two X- Men movies.Singer did an amazing job with Superman Returns. He has made Superman my favorite superhero. He develops the characters beautifully. I really had a lot of sympathy for Superman and what he was going through emotionally, intellectually, physically and even spiritually. Brandon Routh is an absolutely superb Superman. He was perfect in fact! I appreciated that there was not the emphasis on his being some muscle-bound superhero. He didn't need it. Brandon played the nerdy Clark Kent very convincingly and then switched to the confident Superman seamlessly.In fact, I thought the whole movie was seamless. The effects were amazing, and they only added to the overall mood without dominating the film. I still can't get the view of Superman hovering in space with his cape floating without gravity's effects. The stillness and quiet of the space while Superman looks down and listens to all the sounds coming from earth—that was a beautiful sight. I'm so glad that swooshing sounds were not added to Superman flying at faster than a bullet speed!I really loved this movie! It left me feeling great at the end of it all. I want to see it again which is a rare thing for me to admit. Thanks Brian Singer. I've never been one to really go to a particular movie just because someone stars in it or has a particular director, but I definitely will pay attention to a film just because you directed it.

I was slightly confused but picked up pretty quick. For all the publicity on this movie I don't find it as amazing as it was supposed to be. Overall it was good. Casting was weird, A lot of known faces and then lead characters who are barely known. I do suggest you check it out though because people's opinions of this movie diverse.

6,Mediocre,"Superman Returns is OK, but not awesome. I liked the fact they used the original music and i liked how they linked it to the original Superman movies. The special effects are very good and there's some good insights into Superman's character. Brandon Routh makes a decent Superman, but not a great one. Basically, he's imitating the Christopher Reeve Superman, which is fine, I suppose. The only problem is when you spend your time imitating someone else you'll always be second best. If there's another movie, I'd kind of like to see Routh put his own spin on Superman, rather than just trying to be the new Christopher Reeve.As others have pointed out, there's a lot of Christian symbolism in this movie. They seem to be presenting Superman as a sort of Christ figure. Never thought of that angle before, but strangely enough it was these parts of the movie worked the best.Now a superhero movie wouldn't be a superhero movie without some type of threat to humanity to deal with and this ""threat"" is where most of my criticisms are centred. Overall, I didn't care much for Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lex Luthor, he just didn't seem to have much depth as a character. I never really understood just what Luthor was hoping to accomplish with his scheme. To me, the whole ""new land mass"" plot kind of, well...sucked.",0,0,stu9003,"Jul 12, 2006",

The movie contains many subtle references to civilizations as there are the Greeks, Romans and even the still doubted Atlantis. The superhuman respect and love expressed by superman is a beautiful association to great individuals like Christ or mythological figures like Hercules and atlas.In fact what would bring humanity into motion? All great individuals in history could not do it. It's the job of an evil being, like the seductive, cruel, vicious, heartless Lex Luthor, to bring out the superhuman powers.I left the theater with a feeling of let's do it, let's prove that we still can achieve some great things which will lift us above the mediocre level this current civilization has.

5,"Not too ""super""","Overall, it was OK. But for a movie 2 decades in the waiting that is just not good enough. We see some interesting stuff put in by the makers, but the storyline still lacked some needed edge. Although somewhat leaving something for movie-goers to look forward too in the next installment.Brandon Routh looked like a geek out of HS, good for the Clark Kent character, bad for Superman. Superman was supposed to be the MAN, not a geek wearing a cape. Routh's portrayal didn't look ""super"" enough, didn't look powerful enough. Not too masculine. I guess he was a little too baby-faced to be a convincing all-powerful superhero we all know. Again, an OK performance, but not good enough. Hopefully they do something about it in the next movie.I've always loved Kevin Spacey. He was entertaining, to say the least. Not the best Lex in my opinion, but somehow pulled out a convincing performance. look forward to seeing his character develop in the next installment.",1,1,lastgreatman,"Jul 13, 2006",
5,"See it, but don't expect much magic!","After years of struggle and debate Hollywood has finally seen to it that Superman once again takes to the big screen. The producers spared little expense and delivered in creating yet another superbly crafted comic strip, larger than life movie. In the same vain as X-Men and Spiderman, Superman Returns is visually stunning and perhaps outdoes any predecessor in the genre with the score. John Williams was again forced out of retirement to pen the score for the film and as usual he wrote magic.The music is critical and usually sets the tone for the entire film, but it turned out to be a bit of a tease in this case. From the opening credits we are swept into a Superman fanfare that is riveting and reminiscent of a past cinematic era. I was filled with anticipation, believing that the music was proof enough that this was a true, old-fashioned Hollywood blockbuster. And yet, as soon as the movie begins the air begins to leak from the excitement until it is nearly flat.While I agree with the creators that this movie needed to be a sequel in the long series of Superman movies and not another attempt to reinvent the wheel, I simply didn't believe the story and especially the way it was told. The film begins with a world without Superman. He has been MIA for five years as he 'retired' to return to his home planet to observe the destruction. When he returns he is down-trodden, guilt ridden, and introspective about the meaning of life and his duty to fulfill destiny. Superman is cast in a Christ-like manner, as the 'savior' and redeemer of the 'sin of the world.' The religious overtones run throughout the film. And yet, just as we are led to believe that excitement is around the corner we are instead forced to tolerate Clark Kent's awkward return to work and his realization that even his beloved Lois Lane has moved on and is with Richard and now has a son.Kevin Spacey brings the only drama and suspense to the film in his portrayal of Lex Luther. And yet, even he and his haphazard posse are weak. Spacey's Luther was more of an angry imbecile instead of an evil genius. For most of the movie we are left to laugh as he and the gang devise a ridiculous scheme to rule the world. And not once do we really consider that they might just be successful. This is due to the fact that Routh's depressed Superman finally comes to life as he combats his inner demons and realizes his ultimate role in society. Yet here again is another weak performance. He appeared more like a child playing dress-up than the man of steel himself. The same goes for Kate Bosworth's portrayal of Lois Lane. By the end of the film I was begging for Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, and of course, Christopher Reeve. This latest attempt is merely fodder under the feat of the original! Having said all of this, Superman Returns, like all of the others of the genre, is a moral story fit for audiences of all ages. He stands as the noble hero for all of us to admire and emulate. Receiving even more positive points is that the film is drug/sex/language free, thus suitable for all.",1,1,mkprice-2,"Jul 13, 2006",

I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Man of Steel and I was not disappointed! From the very start of the film as the opening credits began to roll I knew I was going to be in for a treat. The opening bars of John Williams score filled me with anticipation, my first Super size treat was waiting for me. The titles had been given a 21st century make over yet retained the same visual and font style of the first Superman film in 1978.As I sat watching the film I knew that people would be comparing this film to the original Christopher Reeve film, however this is a new version for a new generation. A colleague of mine said he felt 12yrs old again when he watched it, and that is what it is all about.My only worries with this film is that there is not enough Superman and the film tries to build a strong story from a potentially weak script.

Spacey isn't very convincing as overt villain Lex Luther (he's much more suitable for subtle evil). I came in expecting a psychological bent to account for the 154 minute length - a la ""Batman Begins"" - but came out realizing that I had been seated an hour longer than necessary.See this movie if you're a buff of the genre or the franchise, or alternatively if you're satiated with large explosions and impressive effects.

,Superman Returns Beautiful but flawed,"I have just seen the Superman Returns movie after a bit of refection here what I think. This film without question has the most beautiful cinematography of any Hollywood blockbuster this year that I have seen X3, MI3 and POTCDMC (The Da Vinci Code, some dude hanging around some painting looking for God is not my bag). The special effects although functional and not very imaginative compared to the competition where well polished. The production design was first rate but again a little uninspired by reusing a lot of what had gone before. As for the cast there's a lot of talent on show that has not been pushed hard enough to take chances and make their characters their own rather than compete with previous in carnations. There is one exception as casting goes they should of made Parker Posey Louis Lane then she would of had some balls and spirit. The script is a mess that feels rushed yet plodding at the same time with no soul. It turns Superman into a signal parent. My only question is that dose he have too pay child support now that he knows and dose he have to take the second weekends of every mouth to see his son. My major problem with Lex Luther is that he has had fives year without Superman to come up with a plan. All he can think of is throwing a bit of rock into the sea for Ocean fronted apartments. He should stop shagging old lady's for money and get with the program maybe get in touch with General Zod for some advice. I saw flashes in this film that could of made this Superman a Crackin beating man of steel yet something was missing thought-out, in a word, fun. I think back to films such as the original Stars Wars, Indy Jones, and to Spiderman to some extent that took you on a ride that was cheesy, a little bit camp and that had you fist pumping at the screen. At the end of the day you can put a turd in a Superman out fit and people will be happy just to see him fly. I don't understand why the people behind this movie where so afraid of change. It has been 19 years since a Quest of Pace it could be anther 10 years after Superman Returns before they get it right. I like know what you think...now.",0,1,sellton29,"Jul 13, 2006",

Lex Luthor (played brimming with madness by Kevin Spacey, but only really scary in one moment) has some crazy idea, but please, its not for a minute believable, doesn't look good and doesn't need two and a half hours to flesh it out.This film would have been so much better if it was 100 minutes, shorn of all the twiddle and concentrating on the action. Then maybe it would have constructed a few more set-pieces like the one where he first meets Lois again (I won't give it away, but that's the stuff.. more please!) Speaking of Lois... who on earth is this woman? She's supposed to have a five year old child but she doesn't look older than a teenager herself. How can she have held a meaningful relationship with Superman five years ago? Casting's all wrong. Nicolas Cage would have given us a much darker, more soul-searching portrayal and Lois needs to be a feisty, intelligent woman (she's supposed to have won a Pulitzer prize), which Teri Hatcher and Margot Kidder both pulled off.Biggest problem with this film though... its dull!

10,"Look into the Sky,","He >>>HAS<<< Returned It blew me away I think Singer has Struck gold on young Brandon Routh he was Amazing, he really took the character to the next level I have no complaints about Kate Bosworth either i thought she was terrific and a good choice for the role tho I do admit having the child with her all the time made it difficult for her to really break out of the shell the Whole scene where they are kicking the crap out of him was very powerful and emotional, I really felt for him i love to see those sort of scenes it reminds me of a similar scene in Robocop two because it reminds you that you can be all powerful but at the end of the day we really are all human beings Lex Luthor was sadistic i loved Spaceys performance People say a lot could have been cut, i admit it was fairly long which i wont complain i would be still watching it now if i could but for those who don't it wasn't that it could be cut it was simply that the film had a lot to put across since it was the first film in 20 years if it was up to me not one of the scenes would have been cut including those that were my only complaint was all the old dialogue from the first film this film is 10 times better than the original We must make sure Singer makes us a sequel because now he has got his case across Superman has returns he can really expand the story and the character he needs to do it soon it he wants to involve his kid because if their not quick they may have to recast him since you all know how fast they grow up My rating 9.9 out 10",0,2,spank_da_monkey89-1,"Jul 13, 2006",
10,Truly a Superfilm!,"First, up until I saw this, Superman The Movie, was the superhero film by which all following superhero films were judged. That is still a great film, but this goes a bit further. First, it cements Bryan Singer as the greatest Superhero Director of all time. X-Men, X2 and now Superman Returns are all excellent, viewable and enjoyable films. The humanity he brings to the film while grounding them in reality and yet still giving us the viewers the superheroics we want, are simply amazing. Brandon Routh was a tremendous Superman, bringing (even though he's not 'human') humanity to the character as did Chris Reeves (Who I think would have been very happy with this film, and had he lived likely gotten a cameo). The homages to Donners films are so beautiful and wonderful, Singers love for the material so evident that it makes this film just an everlasting joy. Another thing is that in this film, Superman is just that, SUPER. He uses all of his powers and they finally got the fact that he can really fly - I mean superfast down as well. This is just such a great movie that I can hardly wait to see it again - and the sequel as well. Perhaps Brainiac is in our future? Great job Bryan, now keep it up, up and awaaaaaaay!",0,2,Polaris1863,"Jul 13, 2006",
10,"Inspirational, a true gem of modern cinema. Thank you.","Superman Returns starring the fresh faced Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel. It is an excellently written and directed piece of work. From the opening credits through to the truly magical flying sequences and well places tense, climatic stages. Superman Returns I believe will become the benchmark of all movies of its genre. It far surpasses the likes of any Marvel/DC comic book to big screen adaption I have seen so far, and I believe many of you may agree it is ""a true gem of modern cinema"".Being a huge Superman fan myself (only recently becoming one might I add) I thoroughly enjoyed Routh's performance as he made for a convincing Clark Kent. His performance can be almost directly linked to the late great REAL LIFE SUPERMAN of Chrisopther Reeves. Routh I believe is worthy of donning the great red cape and suit. Kate Bosworth and James Marsden offered their support, fulfilling their roles more than that of a satisfactory standard.To be frank with you readers, Superman Returns is a masterpiece of Computer graphic technology merging with up to date issues relating to current affairs that we can all relate to in our lives.Superman Returns does fulfil its biggest target, accomplishing the heavy task of relating to its audience as we all understand that at some point in our lives, we need help, we need a saviour and during our journey within the theatre we need Superman.If you let this movie into your heart, I assure you, you will come out of that theatre content and a bigger Superman fan then you ever thought possible.A great movie, wherever and whoever you are.Thank you for helping me escape reality and being brought into this fantasy world where anything is possible.10/10.",3,2,spitfire_demon,"Jul 13, 2006",
8,Not Disappointed,"I cannot remember how long I have been waiting for this film to be released but as the day got closer I couldn't help thinking I was going to be very, very disappointed. The pictures that had been release and the teaser trailers just didn't do it for me.......I needn't have worried - this film is quality and finds itself up there with the original and Superman ii & iii (which I think gets a bad name). All major cast members are excellent and have their own way of portraying their characters. Kevin Spacey makes a nice change to the Luthor that we have seen most recently on Smallville and Gene Hackman's comedic portrayal. Routh has a new take on Clarke Kent - not as clumsy as Reeve but still has laugh out loud moments. There is enough references to the original films to keep the older viewer entertained and the visual effects are stunning. I haven't been to see a film twice since the original Jurrassic Park but I think I will find myself back at the pictures for this one!! Now all I have to do is wait for the next film!!!!",3,2,dansalisbury666,"Jul 13, 2006",
10,Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No It's SUPERMAN!!!!!,"Well this film was certainly no flop...it captured the action, adventure, and romance set down by the old Superman movies, and although Brandon Routh must have been a gamble (being a previously unknown actor) he pulled off a stunning performance as the new Superman. The movie is filled with special effects, and it works tremendously well with fast paced speed shots with our hero, stunning fly-through shots, and great blue-screen shots of our hero in outer space. The effects in this film are phenomenal. I can't wait for the next instalment of Superman (whenver it shall be released)although I read somewhere that we shall be seeing many years worth of Superman as it is an ongoing ten year contract (but I could be wrong). The storyline in this movie had a splendid twist in the identity of Lois Lane's son Jason. No need for DNA testing on that one (when you see the film you'll know what I mean). Go and see it. Old fans shall not be disappointed and new ones will be hooked instantly.

10,Excellent must see movie!!!,"Well opening night here in the UK and I went to see it and I have to say it doesn't disappoint, it was well worth the wait and it's the only film I have seen in recent times that people actually applauded when it finished and what was also a nice touch was in the end credits it said Dedicated to Christopher and Dana Reeve :), so my advice is go and see this movie then go and see it again it's that good and also buy the DVD when it comes out, also the similarity between Brandon Routh and Christopher Reeve is uncanny even when he says Goodnight Lois in the film he sounds exactly like Christopher Reeve!! which is really weird they couldn't have picked a better actor to replace Mr Reeve if they tried.",0,1,conaningra,"Jul 13, 2006",
10,Superman is back!,"Superman Returns is almost perfect, it needs just a bit more action and a little faster pace at the end. Otherwise this movie is great. Brandon Routh gave a wonderful and convincing performance as the man of steel. Wonderful direction by Mr. Singer. The X Men were truly hurt by his absence, but it was Superman's gain. This movie has plenty of character moments that are genuine , you feel for Superman and you see his pain on an emotional level that anyone who has been in love can relate to. And it is all done without making Superman look weak or like a whiner. The next movie I am sure that the stakes will be higher and there will be a lot more action, but this is a very good start.",0,1,kingdavid600,"Jul 13, 2006",
9,Must see it at IMAX - PROMISE ME!!,"You MUST see this movie at an IMAX theater. To do otherwise really does it an injustice. This is a big movie and it is spectacular. I loved the original and was worried that it would not compare. I never thought I would say this - but it was right on the level. This movie respected the older version and still managed to give it a refreshing take. I saw the original when I was 6 and Christopher Reeve was my first boy crush. Now Brandon Routh is capturing my imagination again with his own take on Superman - the man is just ridiculously good looking, just as he should be! He also does an excellent job in both roles - and those were big tights to fill. Please, please see it at the IMAX only - what a treat! I just got back and I'm going back for the midnight show!!

3,This Superman can't  Fly,"Don't waste your money--go rent Chris Reeve's version. This movie did not add anything that hadn't already been explored in the previous film. I thought I would have problems with Routh's mimicking Reeve's acting, but he did an OK job pretending he was Chris Reeve doing Superman. OK I know what you're thinking there's not much to flesh out in the character, but look what Depp did for Willie Wonka-he was wise not to do a carbon copy of Gene Wilder's performance. Next there was the annoying Spacey's performance, don't get me wrong Spacey is a brilliant actor but he can't hack(excuse my pun) Hackman's brilliant performance as Luther. The film makers had great opportunity to introduce us some more mythology and lord knows there is a lot on Superman but they did not.The Film makers chose to take the safe route the only difference was adding a hokey sub-plot on Lois's personal life,who cares! Poor Kate saddled with that truly awful looking wig-- no wonder her acting was bad. I have other concerns but I can't address them now because they contain spoilers. But I can say this-- the actors had large shoes to fill and none filled them!",1,1,Aba74,"Jul 13, 2006",
10,Superman Returns is Supertastic,"The man of steel has returned, bigger, faster and stronger than ever before. I have to say that I had my doubts about this film ever since I heard it was in production. These were for a variety of reasons, one of them being the death of Christopher Reeves and Dana Reeves. However the film is fantastic. Brandon Routh completely blew me away. What a performance from him. He delivered the performance with elegance and poise. Also he has a natural charisma for the role and he has a presence about him on screen similar to Christopher Reeves. Brandon delivers Clark Kent with the same poise and elegance. He is extremely similar to Christopher Reeves, actually the similarities are haunting but wonderful.Kate Bosworth is a bit young for the role of Lois Lane, however this does not detract from her performance. She was good, not brilliant. Kevin Spacey was excellent. He adds a new dimension to the character of Lex Luthor. The story is very clever, the locations are fantastic. And also there are a few twists along the way, along with a few emotional moments.All in all Bryan Singer has done an amazing job. He has stayed true to the original films, but added a modern day suave to the Man of Steel. Well done to all involved in the movie.Jason McCutcheon (Limerick, Ireland)",1,1,jason_mccutcheon,"Jul 13, 2006",

1,Unbearable,"I never thought any comic book film would be as bad as ""Hulk."" I should have never underestimated Hollywood.Bryan Singer has virtually done the impossible: destroy a blooming career and turn into Michael Bay. It's not that this film is a train wreck, it's a capsized beacon out in the middle of space. It takes a lot of talent to completely destroy a franchise, and this film once again proves that someone is always willing to do the heavy lifting for such an accomplishment. Let's start with Brandon Routh. Tall, handsome, and clearly fit for the role. But unfortunately, he's just not an accomplished actor, and it was obvious that Singer did little to help in his development. For this fact alone, it was a shame because Routh is a rare commodity in Hollywood---a strapping man that isn't some boney androgynous girly boy that women seem to love (paging Colin Farrell, Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt). While Routh seemed perfect for his role, everyone else was just so out of place in this film. James Marsden was clueless within his role, Kate Bosworth was too young and proved she's a fraud of an actress and Kevin Spacey was a joke as Lex Luthor. If Parker Posey hadn't already made a fool of herself in that commercial with Jimmy Fallon, I would have said this was her worst role ever. While acting is often on the head of the actors themselves, the director has be taken into account considering actors have to be constantly directed.What I was especially disappointed with was the special effects. With a budget of some 200 million (which was largely blamed on the FX), you think this film would have the best effects ever. Instead, we get rather sad retreads of previous films that made better use of their lesser resources. Nothing about this film really stood out visually as the filmmakers tried painting a nouveau-noir landscape to add some grittiness. I could go one for years about this film, but let's just say it didn't work on a great many levels.",15,19,Agent10,"Jul 14, 2006",
1,Donner's 1978 version was better.,"So what's the verdict? Singer has lost it! What a sorry piece of script writing this was, and what's all this with super boy? Also did you notice we didn't really have much of that Brandon Routh being Clark - was this because the guy was just a walking plank on screen? And don't get me started on that costume!!! Even when the plank was doing Super things like saving the plane or taking on that bad guy with the Terminator's machine gun I still didn't care. The main problem for me was that the script didn't take time to invest in the characters therefore making me not caring about anyone – the only saving grace was Kate Bosworth who in my opinion did a great job being broken hearted although she's a little young to play Lois Lane.There's some impressive sfx (as usual) and a few amusing references to Superman I and II. My problem with it was the story (which was kinda lame and lacked originality) and Lex Luthor's evil scheme (which was really daft).Kevin was fighting against a really under written part and what was the point of Parker Posey being in it, Miss Teschmacher anyone? What was lacking from the whole sorry affair? Even though it looked big and great the epic quality that Superman the movie had was missing. All in all I was rather disappointed and under whelmed by the whole thing. For me, Donner's movie was better and it was wasn't as satisfying as Batman Begins nor as cool as Spiderman 1 and 2.Make mine Marvel, Nuff said!",6,6,iandiaztkz,"Jul 14, 2006",

8,Superman Returns...but to his former glory?,"Superman Returns flew into cinemas nationwide on Friday the 14th of July, and I can say I was one of those who flocked to the cinema the day it hit cinema screens. I sat down with my large portion of popcorn with high expectations for the Lycra-clad man's new adventure, and to be completely honest, it fell slightly short.When the opening credits began, with the familiar theme blaring, I shuffled excitedly as the audience was taken on a journey through space and important names, before landing with a crash at Clark Kent's childhood home. With a short introduction to his powers (for those who may not remember, or be old enough to), we are soon back into thriving Metropolis, as Clark (Newcomer Brandon Routh) Returns to the Daily Planet, home to his ridiculous (and unbelievably obvious) disguise. But when he discovers that his former love, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), is not only spoken for but has a son as well, everything starts to go downhill.Routh takes a lot of expectation onto his shoulders as the Superman himself, and though he does remind me of Christopher Reeves' original performance, he doesn't quite convince me. It may be because he seemed to be lacking a lot of dialogue, and didn't get a real chance to prove himself. Most of his screen time appeared to be taken up with him grimacing or smiling slightly. However, he definitely looks the part, after spending a lot of his time buffing up for the role.Bosworth plays a reasonable Lois Lane, but I fear that she was cast too young and lacked the real fire that Miss Lane once had in the original movies. She annoyed me mostly, but that can be commended, as I have always seen Lois as someone who would try my patience.Kevin Spacey takes the role of Lex Luthor, one of Superman's greatest enemies, and turns in one of the better performances. However, he doesn't seem quite as villainous as I'd imagine him to be, and is upstaged by his companion, Kitty, played by Posey Parker. She turns in a fantastic performance, and raises the most laughs.Overall, the film could have done with having at least 30 minutes shaved off it's running time, and it's plot could have been thickened out much more (the dialogue was very straightforward and lack-lustre), but I did enjoy myself, and my love for Superman has returned with passion. I hope they consider making a sequel, but with a bit more concentration on the plot. With it's amazing special effects, and entertainment value, I recommend it to anyone in need of a good summer blockbuster. Not even Kryptonite should stop you from getting to see it!",0,1,blueeyedangelface,"Jul 14, 2006",

7,Superman Returns! It misses a few beats but hits the mark.,"I'm not going to mention the plot at all in this mini review. All I am going to say is that director Brian Singer has finally revived the Superman franchise with a film that shares the same style and ideas of Richard Donners original classic. It doesn't however surpass Donners film (which is still, in my opinion, the greatest superhero film ever made). The pacing of the film is not up to scratch and the story is a bit thin on the ground. We could have done with a bit more of supes getting along with his daily business of saving people and perhaps a bit more of Kal El shifting between his two identities. Which brings me onto Brandon Routh. Routh is excellent as Kent/Superman/Kal El. Because he's an unknown you only get the impression that he IS all of those characters. Back to the pacing that I mentioned earlier, I got the feeling in several scenes that they could do with holding some of the shots for a little longer. If there is another problem with Hollywood films these days is the editing is all over the place. Superman Returns is no exception. I felt it could have done with a few more epic wide shots and longer cuts. The editing was done by the same fella that scored the music, John Ottman, I don't think Ottman had a very good grasp of John Williams original themes, we need more of the Superman theme, thats what its all about!I am nit picking to the extreme here. Superman Returns is an Excellent film and sits head and shoulders above your Fantastic Fours and your Sin City's. When you buy it on video, place it on the same shelve as the first two films, Batman, Batman Begins and the two Spiderman films.4 out of 5",2,2,biggles1701,"Jul 14, 2006",
9,Magnificent,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I felt it is brilliant and is as near a masterpiece as any superhero movie can get. (BTW I belong to those who were not too impressed with the Spiderman movies).The world a movie with a emotional core comes to mind. However, it is also a riveting superhero movie. I think the airplane sequence had been heralded by many as worthy of the entrance ticket price alone. I totally agree. The minute Superman appeared, it was like going back to my childhood days again. The impact was that amazing to me. The way he used his heat vision, lifted the space shuttle and sent it flying away is incredible. No one else does a rescue scene like Supes. He's a league of his own. What can I say when he landed the plane on the baseball stadium? Sheer awe. It was finished off beautifully with Supes walking into the plane and reassuring everyone with his calm voice. That was the moment for me that Superman totally came alive.Brandon Routh is indeed Superman - or should we say, a Superman for a new generation. His looks, physique, voice and carriage is definitely Superman. There is a human and vulnerable side to his Superman that Christopher Reeves did not have.I liked the movie in every way. Kevin Spacey was wicked and delicious as Luthor. Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane was thoroughly convincing and I felt she had great chemistry with Brandon Routh. Also, the romance was moving.I love the movie. From the casts, the set designs, the costumes, the script, the special effects, the cinematography, the soundtrack and most of all, the direction. This is in the word of one critic, a magisterial direction. Bryan Singer is at the full maturity of his craft and he should be rightly proud of this movie. Who cares if Superman Returns doesn't compare with the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 in terms of box office records? What's important is that it'll still be a good movie a few years down the line and it'll definitely stand the test of time.What I didn't like was the ending. I agreed with most critics that the ending was a bit too draggy and it spoiled the pace of the overall movie. There is a hint of a drag in the first 20 minutes. But that's most probably because I got impatient for Superman to appear.Also, I am a bit uncertain about having a Super-Kid. Will this return to haunt the future movies in the Superman franchise? However, he is a plot element that can be overlooked should they continue the franchise. After all, Superman can get a new love interest.I give this a high rating of 9/10. In one word, this movie is magnificent.",8,5,lyehuat1973,"Jul 14, 2006",
3,OK if you like this kind of thing,"I don't know whether it's much of a recommendation, but ""Superman Returns"" is a better vehicle for this clapped-out quasi-character than poor Christopher Reeve's well-meaning but appalling finale, ""The Quest for Peace"", not least in the realm of visual effects. There are also a few improvements in the supporting cast, Langella's Perry White and Huntington's Jimmy Olsen in particular. The inclusion of a husband for Lois Lane is a good idea, and James Marsden gives him a credibility that the script doesn't. Spacey is Spacey, Parker Posey is a hoot but her character is not given the screen time her talent deserves. The first catastrophe is terrific, the climactic one much delayed and overstretched in a ludicrously over-long movie. Kate Bosworth is less crazy than Kidder - it's an altogether more modern, Rachel Weisz-ish performance, which is good as far as it goes. Routh's casting does the opposite of expunge the memory of Reeve: there is more than just a passing resemblance. Given that someone had to do it, and with no disrespect to Routh, who makes a decent stab at this impossible role, it might have been better to throw continuity to the winds and go for someone way different.For those of us of a certain age, the greatest pleasure of the movie is the appearance of Eva Marie Saint, whose serene beauty seems only to have increased, a challenge to the passage of time. What an amazing presence she has, even in this small role. And it's great that, more than fifty years after On The Waterfront, as the final credits roll, there's her name next to Marlon Brando's again.",0,1,gsygsy,"Jul 14, 2006",
8,Very Enjoyable but a little long.,"Really enjoyed the movie, from the beginning to the end.It was so nice to hear John Williams Superman theme again and out of the three blockbusters this year, X-Men 3, Pirates and Superman I thought this was the best.Could of been about 20 - 30 minutes shorter but at least the film didn't plod along like Pirates did at times.It had Bryan Singers directorial style which was missing from X-Men 3 , the special effects were very good however, as normal the CGI characters were very noticeable at times; but as this seems to be a common theme in the three big films this year.This is only a slight moan because overall the director and cast should be congratulated on an very good production.",1,1,NeilBarnett,"Jul 14, 2006",
10,A Fitting Tribute,"This movie sought to answer two questions: whether the fictional world of Metropolis still needs Superman; and whether the Man of Steel, essentially an overgrown boy scout, can compete with the darker heroes and anti-heroes dominating the silver screen today (such as Batman and the heroes of the Marvel universe). Thus, the question for both worlds is, ""Do we still need Superman?"" After seeing the film, I am happy to report that the answer is a resounding, ""Yes!"" Essentially, this movie pays tribute to that first great film in every single way. While a few myopically see this as ""ripping off"" the first film or as laziness on the part of the filmmakers, the filmmakers saw themselves as paying tribute to that great film that made us believe that a man could fly (containing as it did everything that makes us love the movies). Thus, it helps to see the film in this context. Thus, if you loved the first film, you will almost certainly love this one.Much as he did for X-Men and X2, Singer injected the story both with emotional depth and an intriguing and highly relevant thematic subtext that made what could have been just another summer blockbuster filled with mindless action sequences into something much more. Singer made more effective use of the messianic motif than even the first film did, and although I am not a particularly religious person myself, this fits the Superman mythos like a glove, as this is essentially who the character is: a secular messiah.The high quality acting helped Singer bring this ambitious vision to life. Brandon Routh more than adequately filled the large shoes left by Christopher Reeve, and Richard Donner, the director of Superman: The Movie, wholeheartedly agrees (having said so in an interview with the BBC). Bosworth fittingly played the part of a woman who truly moved on with her life after the man she loved ditched her without so much as a goodbye and displayed true confusion and even bitterness over his vaunted return. Spacey actually outdid Hackman as Luthor, having made him a serious villain that simply exuded hate for the Man of Steel. Finally, Frank Langella and Sam Huntington perfectly filled the roles of Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, respectively.Still, viewers need to know a few things before watching the movie. Although the movie itself fails to make this explicit, press releases make it quite clear that Singer chose to ignore Superman 3 and 4 and instead concentrate on building a story that takes place following Superman I and II. Keep this in mind when viewing the film, and you will not feel lost.Also, try to watch the first two films before watching this one. This film pays tribute to Superman: The Movie in every single way (and Superman II in a more subtle way), and picking up on these references will greatly enhance your experience.Finally, as I hinted before, do not expect a movie jam packed with action sequences. Although the movie certainly contains awe-inspiring special effects and plenty of eye candy in the form of incredible action sequences, the film seeks to make an emotional connection with fans instead of merely titillating them. Much like in the first film, the effects are wisely understated and thus serve the story rather than vice versa. Expect a film of emotional depth instead of a mere action movie.Enjoy the movie, and happy flying!",90,73,markathompson74,"Jul 14, 2006",
6,not bad,"First of all i'd like to congratulate young Brandon Routh on a good portrayal of superman.i very much doubt film makers could have found anyone more like the original superman Christopher Reeve.Secondly i think Spacey who was the star of the show for me does the part of Lex Luthor justice as well,without meaning to knock Gene Hackman great actor that he is,i think his Lex was more panto villain than arch Nemesis to superman.Spacey most definitely portrays an evil villain far more convincingly and helps give the movie a more menacing feel about it.My only complaint about this movie is that it was a little drawn out in places,i'm all for filling in the gaps and then catching up on some of the original characters but i think too much time was spent on this and therefor when we got down to the nitty gritty it did seem like a bit of an anti climax.still it's a decent enough remake with some awesome sfx and decent acting,overall worth killing a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon with.",1,1,RandlePM,"Jul 14, 2006",
2,Superman Returns is boring,"I thought the acting was poor across the board, the quality of the special effects was inconsistent and I was just plain bored for most of the film. I didn't care whether any of the characters lived or died and found none of it emotionally engaging. The whole enterprise seemed indulgent, sloppily plotted and poorly edited. No doubt a sequel will be made and millions will go and see it. For me Superman Returns was yet another example of the contempt Hollywood has for the intelligence of its audience. Now I know it's a summer blockbuster and not Chekhov and I know that a film about an alien who looks human and who can fly isn't exactly based on reality but it should at least allow a viewer to suspend disbelief until it's over.

8,Superman Returns,"Unlike the recent Batman Begins, this is no reinvention of a superhero; it is instead more a continuation, or updating, of the franchise made great by the late Christopher Reeve. Set after Superman II, (thankfully assuming that instalments III and IV never happened, and were both results of very bad dreams) Superman Returns has taken the world that director Richard Donner created and has given it a 21st century sheen. And it works because it does feel like a genuine sequel to the Christopher Reeve films, whilst at the same time successfully updating the look of the film to give us one of the finest superhero films in memory.Of course, no Superman film would work without the Man Of Steel himself putting in a noteworthy show, and newcomer Brandon Routh is no less than perfect. The moment you first see him, most notably as Clark Kent, you'll think you were looking back to the past – the resemblance is uncanny. Some critics have said that they think that Routh should create his own identity rather than merely copy the performance that Christopher Reeve gave, but this is misleading. Firstly, Routh does give the role his own identity; and secondly, seeing Routh being so much like Reeve is actually a good thing – it instantly makes us comfortable with the character; it is arguable that change here would have been a damaging move.Routh is also clearly having fun as the kindly and clumsy Clark Kent, whilst switching instantly to the majestic power that embodies Superman. His reactions when he returns to earth after a five year trip to Krypton are made entirely believable (from finding out Lois is a mother to discovering Lex Luthor is out of prison) because we utterly believe in him. Also, the writers have done the character justice by not changing him – he is torn by emotions inside him, but the film never feels as dark as films like Hulk or Batman Begins. It has its moments, but Superman is still portrayed as the clean-cut hero that he is, and in a world where summer blockbusters are becoming ever more ""gritty"", it is a nice relief to see one that doesn't need to follow that trend.The film is all about heart; whilst there are action sequences – and there are some staggering effects which create some frankly mind-blowing sequences – the majority of the story concerns Superman's and others' reactions to his return. However, even at over two and a half hours, it never feels too long (except maybe a little over-egged at the end), and the emotional scenes are well handled without become too soppy or clichéd. Of course, this eventually gives way to concentrate on Lex Luthor's plan to grow a new continent – using stolen technology from Superman's Fortress of Solitude – in his constant ploy to own real estate (and given that he is only human, this plot is actually understandable, despite many claims to the contrary). There is a brutal scene which pushes the limits of its 12A rating, and the whole segment is thrilling and gripping – finally the ""invulnerable"" superhero actually might be in for more than even he can handle.Kevin Spacey seems to be relishing his role as Lex, giving Gene Hackman a run for his money. He retains a certain element of ""camp"", but he is also much more sinister than Hackman ever seemed. He also has some great interplay with Posey's Kitty, bringing back memories of Miss Teschmacher from Superman I, with more humour. The other supporting cast are all okay, though not given huge amounts of screen time. Lois Lane, as played by Kate Bosworth is good, but she's no Margot Kidder – she's not as feisty and seems too slight to truly capture the original Lois, but she portrays Lois' bitterness at Superman's departure well.In the end, one wishes they had included more of Superman being super, but it is to Bryan Singer's credit that he doesn't need to fall back on another action sequence to keep our attention, unlike other blockbusters. Fans of the original films will enjoy the many nods to the franchise, from the same introduction title sequences, to that score integrated wonderfully with John Ottman's new score (it will give you goosebumps!), to the use of dialogue lifted from the Donner films. The action sequences are all extremely well done, from a bank robbery sequence to an amazing mid-air rescue of a stricken passenger plane, and they are combined nicely with the plot and emotional scenes.Superman Returns sets itself up nicely for a sequel (which is currently being written), and one cannot help but wish that the time in between the two films would fly past ever more quickly. Superman Returns has reset the bar for superhero films, and is easily the best blockbuster of the year.Rated: 9/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",3,2,jon2005,"Jul 14, 2006",

I can't wait to see superman in action , again and again, and again...Hope there will be more actions on the next superman movie. and hey, show more bad sides of Lex Luther,and what about exposing some more power from the little superman? Just a suggestion, but i think it will work... and hey gonna love superman all over again.one more comment, superman looks more familiar to Clark Kent on this movie.Clark Kent here is more glamorous and more handsome.show a little bit old fashion ways of Clark Kent, enough to convince us why ms. lane won't fall head over heals over him.

2,"Its a bird, its a plane, its... a terribly overrated movie","OK, firstly, i am not a great fan of superman. I think he is ridiculously over-powerful, and frankly unimaginative. The movie contained only one of these traits. I wasn't intending to see this movie, as i believe superman isn't very interesting, but my friend had managed to get me free tickets. Even then i was debating whether to see it, so i searched it up on my trusty IMDb, and with a rating of 7.3, i was willing to clear my mind and view it. Oh what a bad mistake that was.So the movie, what was wrong with it? I suppose the special effects were fairly decent, although definitely nothing special. The acting was below average, but i sympathise with Brandon Routh, his script and character left him cornered into a bland performance. However, even this would not have made it a bad movie, that honour would go to the storyline. One word: cliché. It was predictable, and generic. A ""Hero returns, nearly dies, but comes back and saves the world"" with a laughable bit of love thrown in.Yes, OK, i will admit that my bias against superman didn't help, but c'mon people, he is (essentially) invincible! Can move at nearly the speed of light, super strong, can fly, heat vision, breathe in space, breathe underwater... honestly. His one weakness, a little chunk of kryptonite, which he is ""vulnerable"" to. I wont say anymore for fear of spoilers.One last qualm; the time period?? One minute the cars and clothes made it seem like a 1980s new york, and then the next, a kid pulls out a camera phone. It was confusing for me at least..The beginning was not so spectacular, the middle was dull and predictable, and the ending was just icing on a very cheesy cheese cake....",0,2,supercoolfred,"Jul 14, 2006",

8,Relive Your Memory,"This movie is a good one.Brandon Routh has done a good job as Superman, although not as strong as Christopher Reeve. Christopher was more believable when he acted as a dumb reporter, Clark Kent. Brandon gives the impression that he is a clever guy when being Clark Kent.It depends on your liking, but I like Christopher's version. Some dumb down-to-earth reporter who nobody would have guessed as Superman. I guess, it is not Brandon's fault. The director and scriptwriters should have done a better job in this area.The first action in this movie is very very impressive, although it is done with very much American flavour. You will know what I mean if you see this movie. Hint: what is the most popular game in US? Other hint: aeroplane.This movie shows the other side of Superman as a normal human being with emotion. Brandon acts very well when he drops a tear upon hearing Lois Lane ""confession"" (read: lie ) to Richard White. I can actually feel the sadness inside Superman's heart. He flies away to the outer space to mollify his sadness.Not so subtle difference between this movie and the first Superman movie is the way Brandon standing tall and just flies away. Christopher Reeve had to make a bit of a jump and flew. In this movie, Superman flies more smoothly and it seems that Earth gravity doesn't affect him at all. He can fly whenever he wants. No preparation to fly.I don't quite agree with the director's choice for Lois' part played by Kate Bosworth. She reminds me of Victoria Beckham: long and beautiful hair, slim body, glamorous face, too sexy to become a reporter; and yet here is a woman who won Pulitzer Prize. For me personally, Kate is not convincing as a top reporter. (Search in pulitzer.org to see the people who won Pulitzer Prize.) Apart from her appearance, she is not convincing either as a mother whose only son is a product with the man she truly loves. In a scene where she and her son and Richard are struggling under water, she doesn't make an attempt to put her son as the first priority. Instead, Richard holds her son, while Lois is trying to escape.If Superman does belong to human race, not only America or Europe, where on earth does it show that he is helping Asian countries? African countries? Australia? I can't blame the director because the movie will be far too long with those scenes, I guess.Now, what about Lex Luthor? Is Kevin Spacey any good? Well, not bad, but not as powerful as his other roles, especially in The Usual Suspects. I can't find malicious intent in his eyes. He is convincing as a clever and talented man, but not as an evil. Gene Hackman was not convincing either as an evil man. Too much laugh.Should you see this movie? Yes, why not. It's worth your money. Under 3 hours for £6.95 is not bad, is it? But, most of all, this is a Brian Singer film. You can enjoy the experience. Trust me. Before the film started everybody in the theatre is talking, eating popcorn and making all sort of noises. Once the film started until the end, everybody seems to enjoy it. Silence throughout.",4,4,notselfishnotreally,"Jul 14, 2006",

,"Fulfilling Film, but a tad short of the original","When I saw Superman Returns, I had some pretty high expectations. Actually they were more like hopes of this film reviving the saga like Batman Begins did for Batman. And it came close to doing just that. The story was a little more complicated than the first, which may have downed the mood a bit. But the acting was pretty good indeed. Brandon Routh did a fantastic job as the man of steel, but sadly he lacked the feel and charisma that Christopher Reeve had. He was superman, and nobody will probably ever replace him. Kevin Spacey did a captivating job expressing Luthor's evil side as good as Gene Hackman did with his comedian side. The other actors were pretty good and believable. But I think personally what may have downed this movie the most is that it was meant to be a continuation from the second, but i did not feel that at all at any moment. but this movie was still a great reprising experience. 7/10",1,1,kymmr2,"Jul 14, 2006",

9,Very powerful movie,"Surprisingly, I found this to be the best of all Superman movies, even the first. Very powerful, very intense. The attitude of the ""people on the street"" has changed in this movie to be almost reverent and awed. And Superman has achieved more global responsibility and appeal. He helps people on other continents now! I recommend that everyone (over the age of about 8 or so) go to see this movie! It is probably too intense and violent for anyone younger.The touches of continuity with Superman I and Superman II were well-appreciated. Superman is definitely and lonelier and more mature person now. You can feel his emotion as he struggles with Lois Lane and her new life situation.",2,3,hendros,"Jul 14, 2006",
8,Better than I expected...,"I went in expecting this to be a teeny bopper version of Superman. Well, I was surprised (and shouldn't have been, being Bryan Singer was on it). Essentially, this is more a continuance of the original series rather than a complete rehash (which is also what I expected). First, big kudos to Kevin Spacey, who gives a more accurate Lex Luthor than Gene Hackman ever did (not to mention funnier). Second, the new Superman pretty much holds his own against Christopher Reeve's portrayal, with a little more goofiness as Clark. Everyone else pretty much did a great job.However, one noticeable improvement over the first 4: the effects. I recently saw Superman 3, and looking at the effects now, they were pretty lame (good for their time, though). We all know CGI has come a long way, and let's face it: looking back at the first 4, while technological marvels of their time, they were not the most convincing things. So the effects would be like comparing the Harryhausen dinosaurs from King Kong to the CGI dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. Similarly, the effects help propel the story.Only negative comment: it is long--2.5 hours at my count (see IMDb for more accurate timing), which made the film drag at times, but otherwise, great popcorn flick.",2,2,padiyark,"Jul 14, 2006",

3,Waste of time,"Contrary to other reviewers on this site, i thought this was a terrible film. Brandon Routh deserved no more than his $1 million fee, for as far as i can tell he actually did no acting, simply looking dorkish as Clark and pulling poses as superman. Bosworth was a horrible Lois Lane not a patch on Teri Hatcher in the TV series. The plot was terrible and i simply couldn't wait for it to finish. Without Spacey this would go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen,(It still isn't much better than the worst). All i can hope for now is that other people wont go to see this in an effort to hold back its box office takings, however unlikely that may be. I just hope that people will judge this film on its individual merits rather than instantly deciding upon its excellence simply by being a ""superman"" movie.",1,5,cassell28,"Jul 15, 2006",

I found them lacking something, it's like the visuals without the meat.And Superman Returns is exactly the same. The story is weak, the acting and casting relatively poor (although Routh does an admirable job as Superman / Kent), and the whole film seems to hang on an emotional centre. It's more like Dawson's Creek than Superman. It ambles along with lots of very slow points and Superman is relegated to something of an emotional plot piece.It's overly sentimental and there are some scenes (like the hospital scene) I just found a little grating. It's like a nod to the original movies, but a paler and somewhat hollow version.It's a good movie, but it's not a great movie. It's no Richard Donner movie!

9,"I wish I was Lois Lane, I wish Superman is real, I do!","I watched Superman Returns today, and there's only one thing I wanted afterwards: I wish he was real! The story is okay.. I mean.. you know what's going to happen anyway, but hey, I was biting my nails all through the movie, going ""Quick, Superman!! Quick!!! Aaaaa!!!!"" I was a bit bothered by the fact that this version of Superman went a bit off-track from the original story of Superman, with Lois Lane not knowing Clark Kent's real identity and such.. and another part of the story which I won't say because it's a spoiler (something to do with the kid).The ending of the movie was also a bit unsatisfying because it ended just there. Just there. It doesn't end-END. It doesn't end with maybe-there's-a-second-movie-coming-END. It doesn't end with Lois-will-be-with-Superman-END. It just ENDS there, not at the beginning of another story, not in the middle of any story, and not at the end of any story either... It just bothers me.. because with Spiderman you know there's another movie coming, with X-men III you know that's the end of X-men movies unless they make another X-men movie with a bunch of other x-men characters..And I was really disturbed with the fact that Lois doesn't find out about Clark.. because it just.. urgh! You know!? Actually the whole movie really talked about Superman more than Clark Kent. I can really count the scenes where there was Clark using my 5 fingers. But i guess it's OK, i mean.. it IS titled Superman Returns, not Lois & Clark's Adventures.BUT! I just fell in loveeee with Superman! And no, not Brandon Routh, even though I bet I would fall over heels too if I see him in real life. But Superman... tsk tsk tsk.. I just wished I was Lois Lane. And I wished that Superman was real! After I finished the movie and was waiting for the bus, I actually looked up (it was a cloudy sky) and .. ahem... looked.. for.. the Man of Steel, to see if he would just fly over the buildings over my head.The movie is soooo good at making sure this hero icon is as real as he can be. And man, is he a hero! At times I even think the movie sort of overdid it a little because it made Superman looked like God.. landing down from the sky in such peacefulness (with the choir music in the background), being at so many places to save ppl in one night, that rare shy smile Superman gives after helping people.... They also did a bit too much on the publicity thing. The movie made Superman looked like he's got a large ego to match his muscles. Waving his hand at a bunch of baseball spectators while he's on camera. I mean, wouldn't it be better if he just smiled and flew, but no, he had to wave, then smile and flew away.Brandon is a bit too young for a Superman that fights with the Lex Luthor of Kevin Spacey's age. But it really doesn't hurt because Brandon IS good looking. Eh.. I don't mind. Superman just bowled Spiderman - and X-men and Daredevil and Batman (not that he's got any super powers..) or any other superhero - over, because SUPERMAN IS THE SUPEREST SUPERHERO, EVER!

6,'We Don't Need Another Hero' by Tina Turner,"'We Don't Need Another Hero' by Tina Turner summed by the beginning of this one. Lois Lane wins an award for writing a paper on 'Why the world doesn't need Superman' and from then on in it becomes typically cheesy and predictable.Now maybe we should start on a negative note so I may end on a high. This film goes on for much too long; if you have an opportunity to miss the first hour take it! How the director thought he would entertain an audience after putting them in such a bad mood is beyond me?! Some of the actors aren't up to the requirements of their part either, Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane) looks completely out of place, her character is awkward and I don't think she has learnt how to make the balance between an alpha female and a female who is passionately in love trying to run from her feelings - she looks like a fish out of water to me. Sam Huntington (Jimmy) is also rather poor, again I would like to see someone who tries and means well but just can't make it (like the original Jimmy) but this new version seems to fit in line with egalitarian issues surrounding the workplace. To put it frankly, he looks like someone who is not up to the job but has been recruited to represent minority groups – not what I expect from Jimmy.Onto a more positive note though, after taking some aspirin to get over the first hour of the film it does begin to pick up. The tradition of superman has been well carried by the director (Bryan Singer) and some characters more than make up for others. Brandon Routh is a brilliant actor and well worthy of the superman part he plays and Kevin Spacey proves to us once again that he truly is one of the greatest living actors in this day-and-age. Despite a reasonably predictable ending the film isn't too bad and the idea is very good. The storyline is Lex Luthor takes crystals from one a superman's layers' and uses it to create land, however, in doing so he is going to send the rest of the world under sea and kill millions/billions of people in doing so. It's a clever idea and definitely believable, again something typical of the old superman films. Predictably you get the old cliché of good versus evil etc. In all honesty if this film was better casted and they cut the first hour out it would have been a much better film. After giving the first third of the film 0/3 and taking a mark of for the poor casting we are left with a pretty average 6/10 for a film that was billed to be the greatest film this year.

5,Ultimately overlong,"I seem to be in the minority on this but (and I'll avoid spoilers)... The plot seemed almost an afterthought next to the set pieces. And ultimately, as fantastic as these are they do not make a great movie. Routh was perfect as Superman. Too perfect perhaps as he evoked Reeves in just about every aspect of his performance. Regardless, it certainly doesn't disappoint on account of him. However, Spacey fails to even manage 2 dimensions as Lex Luthor - and the script seems to treat him as an incidental character by comparison to the same characters portrayal by Gene Hackman. Lois is too young. And her other half would have been better off as Cyclops! But the biggest problem for me - the film just dragged! It could easily have been half an hour shorter... Can't say that I'll be waiting for the next instalment with baited breath... A shame since the director is capable of so much more.",1,4,mierluin,"Jul 15, 2006",
8,You'll believe a man can fly...,"Superman Returns! Singer has done it! He has brought Superman back to our screens! The way Supe flies is just awe-inspiring and there were many small details of the flying that just blew me away. His cape steals the show! Brandon Routh is very good as Superman, he knows how to hit the right notes and looks great in the suit. He has the 'Superwalk' and the 'Superpose' down! Kate Bosworth looks a lot better compared to Margot Kidder who I never thought was that great looking but saying this, Bosworth's performance isn't a touch on Kidder's. She doesn't do very much with the little she's given. The action sequences were handled very well and Routh makes a formidable Man of Steel, his performance is at times a sensitive one. Considering this is a sequel to the Reeve's films of the 70s I can be forgiven for making comparisons to those films and I think the biggest let down is Routh's and Singer's handling of Clark Kent. Kent is pretty much inconsequential and they've gone down the Clark Kent as the alter ego route which takes away much from the Daily Planet sequences which may have humorous moments but seem empty in comparison to the original films. Clark Kent doesn't get enough screen time for my liking and is far too two dimensional as there is literally ZERO tension between Kent and Lane which shouldn't be the case this far into the relationship. I think Kevin Spacey makes a great Lex Luthor taking away much of the cartoony buffoonery of Gene Hackman's performance which I always found was a little too ham-fisted for Superman's arch nemesis although Spacey still suitably has fun with playing the bad guy. This film is definitely worth seeing just for the Superman sequences even if some of the liberties taken with the story would annoy some comic book fans... Personally it was such a pleasure to see Superman in action again that I was able to ignore some of the slightly dodgier plot areas particularly with regards to the fruits of Superman and Clark Kent's labors... I think the biggest advantage of following through the films of the 70s is that Singer got to keep the score of the original two which still shimmers and brings goosebumps even to the hardest of film going hearts. Its may not be perfect but is certainly worth a look.",3,2,NeoNsMoKeJaZz,"Jul 15, 2006",
1,made to be put in a McDonald's happy meal,"This was such a disappointment and I really wasn't expecting much. The basic problem is that the director (who not surprisingly also was involved in the script) doesn't seem to care about anything more than superficiality. The whole thing is about as interesting as the little plastic merchandising this film seems to have been made in order to flog, rather than as a film to be enjoyed by audiences. The story made very little sense with nothing explained and great gaping inconsistencies created because the director seemed determined to have a cast of 23 year olds in all the main parts. The result is that Lois Lane would have had to be 16 years old when she joined the daily planet, 18 when she had her child and still managed to hold down a very prestigious job at a major newspaper. OK OK it's not supposed to be completely realistic but COME ON! If the whole premise is that Superman has been gone for five years then surely something could have actually happened in that time?Lois wins a Pulitzer prize for a fluff piece titled ""Why the world doesn't need Superman"" and although we never actually hear her argument for this award winning insight... the fact is that it quite obvious that the world is getting along quite well. When Superman does get back he gets his curl in a knot protecting the world from bank robbers (apparently there are no major civil wars, starving millions, AiDS epidemic or weapons of mass destruction in the world of Superman so again you gotta wonder why the world ever needed him in the first place and certainly no one would have noticed his absence.)Added to the impossibly young age of Lois is the fact that she also looks like a gust of wind would knock her down... where oh where are the feisty strong looking women who had a bit of upper body strength??? Karen Allen where are you? (Yes I know I think she's in an insane asylum too but can you blame her the way real women are treated in Hollywood.)Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor had very little to do and again believability just wasn't there. we were meant to believe he got to serve only 5 years on a double life sentence because superman didn't turn up to a court date???? Plus his dastardly plan made absolutely no sense... sure he can build a land mass out of crystals but it's hardly fertile ground... people would be as well off living in the north pole or the Simpson desert. I could go on and on about the stupidity and pointlessness of the story and problems with every single scene... but basically it's simply another example of Hollywood ignoring story for special effects and creating a blockbuster of a failure.",4,8,vampiresan,"Jul 15, 2006",

10,"""Superman Returns""","Imagine you've been asked to make a 21st-century Superman movie, but you can't upset the stalwart comic book fans of the last 60 years, you can't upset the long-time Christopher Reeve fans, you can't upset the action-loving movie-going audiences, nor the ""Smallville"" fans, and balance that against the fact that most superhero action movies have either been ""inside job"" movies which ring hollow, or lame plots (specifically, ""Superman III"").This movie succeeds if you wanted a ""re-imaginging"" of the original movie; and yet, the characters are true to everything you've grown up with, plus incredible special effects (watch the concussion in the jet as it makes its ""landing"") and the additional constraint that everyone agree's that it's probably time to get Superman past Lois.It also succeeded if you wanted something new. Lois and son; Richard is neither weasel nor killed; the screenwriters took the high road and made Richard competition without being an enemy; Perry White is actually a nice guy in his old age without letting up on the ""tough boss"" image. But to me, Richard wins hands-down as the the surprise character in the entire movie. The most disappointing script support in the movie was for Jimmy Olsen, though. A big opportunity missed, there.Parker Posey's character, ""Kitty,"" is left with a lot of potential for the next movie. She didn't do much and certainly didn't do as much for the plot as Gene Hackman's sidekick in the original movie, but to me, her character's strength lies in the potential she has to ""get motivated to get smart"" and oppose Lex. It was also a little creepy how they made her look like Margot Kidder. It did constrain her character too much.As far as plot goes, the screenwriters did a nice job: Lex Luthor does the unthinkable and takes something of Superman's that we've taken completely for granted over the last 30 years and uses it to potentially destructive and horrible consequences--and yet still in its own way, mimicking the plot of the original ""Superman"" movie. The difference is, this movie won't date itself in 20 years.And they even paid the requisite homage to Christopher Reeve in the last 30 seconds of the movie, without having to sully any memories or even admit that the first ""Superman"" movie sure didn't stand up well to the sands of time.To succeed, the franchise is going to have to stay true to the comics though, but needs to avoid the ""Batman/Mr. Freeze"" phase that ruined the Batman franchise.With the creators of ""House, M.D."" on the scene behind the production of this movie, I think the franchise is in great hands.The best inside joke: ""It's like an Academy Award--people don't remember what you won it for, only that you won it.""

Everyone asks how the hell can you replace Christopher Reeve, you cant, but what you do get is a very similar and brilliant performance from Brandon Routh who gets Christopher Reeves mannerisms of Clark Kent down to a T. Not only does he look the part he plays the part as well. Kevin Spacey is like in any other film, just brilliant and Kate Bosworth As Lois is good but for me too nice and weak compared to Margot Kidders character.The plot which i wont go into is again like the first in a sense in that Lex Luther is after land/real estate but it is completely different to the first in its execution and outcome. The effects are superb and the flying is totally convincing (you'll remember the double plane rescue for a while).Die hard fans of the original will love the opening credits, an exact recreation of the original and hearing the music in the cinema bought a tear to my eye. That said the end has been exactly recreated where superman is in space sways from left to right, smiles at the camera and flys off, superb. A big impact is the archive footage of Marlon Brando which was definitely needed in the film, and also a few phrases from the original thrown in as well.All in all acting was great, action was superb, and probably wont win any awards for the plot, but every superman fan thinking the worst for this film can lay those thoughts to rest because this was a fantastic film rivalling or even beating the originals.

So,Brandon Routh is very much handsome as Clark Kent/Superman...He is looking a lot like Christopher Reever, without substitute him, because Christopher will always be Superman...So....there is a big wrong defect on this film: we always be that Clark Kent/Superman has blue eyes and Brandon Routh has brown eyes...On this film,he's using colored contact lenses(blue),but in any scenes he is not using it;in others, he is using.I believe that this is a serious defect, because to the eyes of the viewers of the Superman it was strange...by the way, for all people.After all of accounts,Superman does not have blue eyes? So, why Brandon Routh did not use the colorful lenses of contact the entire time? It would be more natural of what in determined scenes to see him with blue eyes and in other scenes to see him with brown eyes! It is the question: Why not the integral use of the blue lenses of contact?Why this fails so clear appearing in the film? It will be that the producers No turn this imperfection in the edition the film?

It was with certainty a grotesque and very ugly imperfection for a film of so huge transport and so magnificent and fantastic history, after transcripts 20 years to be made… E congratulations for Brandon Routh: it does not substitute (nobody will substitute) Christopher Reeve (our perpetual superman), but is perfect in the paper of the Superman.

5,Superman doesn't fly,"John Williams full time on the score, a believable story and most importantly, decent film editing might raise this movie above my rating of 5. Overly long with no great dramatic moments, it's just one scene tied to another. Brandon Routh is terrific, but wasted. Kate Bosworth is badly mis-cast, as is Frank Langella. Shannon Dougherty in the Lois part would bring the prickly quality Margot Kidder had but Bosworth totally lacks. Good editing and a decent musical score would help provide some drama as the double jeopardy save Lois and catch the helicopter sequence brought to Superman the Movie. This movie misses each and every chance to inspire. Great special effects must be believable. Lowering a jetliner from vertical to horizontal by holding one tiny spot on the nose isn't believable. Flying up under a bad engine (per Superman the movie) is. Lifting an island ... well, that's hard to quantify in it's superness.. but bringing a boat to a police station... not so hard. My point? Just because you can do things with a computer.. don't you first ask if they further the story and the overall experience? Perhaps ""super"" scenes involving something closer to the reality would bring the gut wrenching quality missing from this version. Bottom line...special effects can't replace editing, storytelling and a great score. If Richard Donner had the tools available for this version, who knows what would have resulted, but it definitely would be something I want to watch more than once, rather than struggle to stay awake through.Hope the next chapter is better!",1,2,t_marcucci,"Jul 15, 2006",
10,superman returns on DVD,this film was awesome and the people who say it is not need to pull there head out of there ass. Getting to the point when can we expect to see this movie on DVD. I know it is a little two early but I am really wondering. Also what king of special features are the going to have on the DVD. One more thing did any one see the special on logo news about Superman's bulge in this movie. if you have can you tell me about it cause i missed it. I do not understand why people hate this move so much. it is clearly one of the best movies this summer. If you have not seen this movie i highly recommend it because this movie is so great. It is the best movie that i have seen in a very long time.,1,3,Moviemaster89,"Jul 15, 2006",
8,Superman returns... and about time...,"I did my best to ignore hype and drivel about this movie, I wanted to see it for myself and enjoy the next installment in what I remember from my childhood as the most amazing set of movies I ever saw.I remember seeing the Supmerman movies and thinking like many other kids, 'Wow, this guy flies. He's cute and he's just such a nice guy. I want to be Superman when I grow up'. Don't roll your eyes, Superman is a truly inspirational character, and Christopher Reeves will always be remembered for his awesome part in bringing this character to so many viewers in such a way that you feel like you're right there with him.I was excited sitting in the cinema waiting for my first glimpse at this fresh face playing my childhood hero. The opening credits were just great, they take you back to the original movies, the music and the sweeping text is just great.Routh does a superb job, there are close-up shots of Superman in this film where you can swear you're looking into Reeves' face, Routh masters the bumbling Clark Kent to perfection, tripping over his thoughts and words just like old times.Lastly, the new suit is great. A modern version of the old spandex suit with all the hero suit aspects of recent films (Spiderman, X-men etc) and Routh wears it well, possibly not as bulky build as Reeves but certainly some eye candy to be enjoyed.I simply cannot wait to see more Superman movies come now, Routh is a great actor and would do well to continue in the roll for at least a few more movies.The world does need Superman.

3,"Superman does some heavy lifting, but doesn't throw a single punch!","I saw this the Tuesday night it opened, and I was really disappointed. At the time, I had read only the ravest of rave reviews, so I was expecting something really special. Why not? Filmmakers like Sam Raimi have finally figured out how to bring comic book heroes to the big screen. Even the weak entries into the Marvel/DC et al inspired genre, like the Hulk and the Fanatastic Four, have had their inspired moments. But the critics didn't line up for those like they did this colossal miscue. SR's inspired moment happens early on, when Krypton's greatest son thwarts an airplane disaster. It's his comeback to the world stage after five years of self imposed exile. It involves a lot of heavy lifting, and is the template for almost every damn thing SMan does in the rest of the movie. Something heavy is about to fall, SMan shows up just in time, and moves it somewhere else. UHaul should have been the sponsor for this film. Each time, Singer needle drops the old John Williams' score. After an hour of this repetition, the film becomes a bore. Superman doesn't throw one punch. Which is really an odd filmmaker choice for the greatest of superheroes. All the other superheroes in all those other movies throw punches. Or if they're like Storm or Cyclops, and punches aren't their strong suit, then they lightning, or flames, or laser beams. In this one, Lex Luther throws more punches than SMan. Singer's vision of SMan as the superhuman dolly wears thin, but could have been a more exciting watch if the threat was better defined. I can't give this plot point away, but the world menace is about the most unexciting, unsexy, uninspired piece of science class slide show bullshit you could imagine. I don't understand how Singer could have thought this wearying danger could crystallize into a fun watch. It's never really explained how this danger effects power sources, but it does. Singer's X-Men bad guys, his Usual Suspects antagonist, are real delights. What happened here? If Superman would have battled evil robots from Krypton, or just about anything else nasty and violent, this would have been so much better. It doesn't help that we never really get to know this new Superman. Sure, the facts about him are given; he loves Lois, he's a stranger in a strange land, etc. The camera spends so little time on him when it should, you don't get a feel for what's happening in SMan's head. A good example of this is a scene early on when Clark and Jimmy go to a bar. SMan has just got his old job back, he's just learned some important news about Lois, and now we get to settle in with him and see how this new world is making him feel. Except the editor (John Ottman) cuts to everyone BUT SMan. He actually spends more time on the bartender, a cameo role, then on our protagonist. It's not the actor's fault. The old Superman movie spends time on CReeve's. We get to know him. By the end, we like him. But this new SMan is treated like a mannequin, with little time allotted to close-ups. The editing is blender-ific, chop-city madness. It's called storytelling, folks, and you really dropped the ball here. Raimi spends time on Peter Parker's FACE. You know this kid so well by the end. You really care about him. Same is true for the latest Batman. But not here. How do filmmakers this big, with the kind of resources they're given, foul up the basic rule of letting the audience get to know the protagonist? Some filmmakers get so big they forget that they are storytellers first. They make a film or two that is a big disappointment, and then they return to their old form. I hope that's the case here.",20,19,jooillim,"Jul 15, 2006",

Everything from the opening credits to the ending was superb.Director Bryan Singer has made a great Superman film.Starting with the casting of an unknown,Brandon Routh who is perfect as Superman.As well as Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor and Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, all deliver wonderful performances.The special effects were amazing ,You truly believe that a man can fly.I don't understand why some critics and some movie goers go on saying it wasn't a great film, well i'm here to tell you differently that Superman Returns is truly a masterpiece.It is why we go to the movies in the first place to escape and enjoy.Superman Returns is the best summer movie of 2006.P.S.

1,My Superman Returns Review!,"Today I saw Superman Returns, in the Morning... Now I wont get into how I saw it, where, with who, the time or even the reason why I was there watching it! When doing a review somethings are just best left not said... You know helps build up a bit of mystery. :)But lets just start of by saying that well for the last year, and a half I have been reading up info on this movie, and checking out Singers Blogs, and like a lot of others out there I also bitched in forums about the colors on the suit, the age of these actors, especially Brandon who looks WAY to young for the role, and yeah about the kid being a bad idea to put in this movie, and if its Superman's Son that its even a worse idea, so on, and so on, etc...You know the normal stuff people have been bitching about...I was a bit excited when Roger Ebert panned this movie because I tend to love movies that he hates.. I mean he loved Charlies Angels, Garfield 1, and part 2! I mean the guy has really let his taste in movies go down the drain in the last few years so here I thought that I would probably love the movie, and that it would help bring back my favorite comic book hero into the collective conscious... Or at least to the big screen for a few more sequels... Hell I would have even been happy if it were on the level of Daredevil or the Blade trilogy... But the whole time I was wishing that all my fears would be put to rest when the movie started playing.I can say that For a single minute I felt like a kid again watching Superman for the first time! Then something happened! The movie started playing... It was all downhill from there!Now I'm going to try, and stay spoiler free because I know how you Fanboys hate spoilers! HehI saw the movie with as much open mindedness (is that a word?) as possible, and I really tried to clear my mind out of all the negative buzz this movie has had from the start, and my own personal feelings on the cast, and what not... The results were still what I had expected.The movie's first act is very slow in pace, and it really takes a long time to build to any sort of action, and this helped put the person who I saw the movie to asleep... He said he was tired but we both knew the real reason! The first ACT IS BORING!!! After a long, and some what 3rd rock from the sun looking intro which used the same text for the names as the original movies we get to see Smallville, and Martha Kent on the farm, and a ball of fire shoots from the sky into the corn fields.. Martha along with her dog rushes to see if its her son who she hasn't seen in 5 years.I wonder now how bad the footage that was cut in the start of the film might have been for it to be cut!? After the intro credit the movies look is very close to the Donner pictures, and Singer did a nice job of matching this movie to those movies. Everything is actually pretty decent until we get Clark to the Daily Planet... This is where the movie really goes downhill.Brandon As Superman himself has times where he does a good enough job but those are when he has almost no lines AT ALL! But then we have times where he does speak, and boy is he stiff, and wooden as an actor, and this makes him look out of place as Superman, and to top it off at times when he's saying his lines if you look at his eyes I swear its like he's following along in a cue card... Also doesn't help that the storyline makes Superman out to be a deadbeat dad, a Liar, and a fool!IF you really sit there, and go scene by scene, and try to pick apart the movie It seemed to be at least to me just a re-telling of the first movie with a few added or changed story points to help make it seem like its a sequel to the first 2 movies, and not a remake... But there's A lot of the same elements which Donner used in his origins in this movie.. The flashback scenes while not many at all were also not needed, and actually badly done! Clark doesn't wear glasses as a kid, and someone should have told Bryan Singer this bit of info before he made the movie.. You know since we all know he doesn't read the comics he might not know this.One would think that with a reported 260million dollar budget that they could have at least got better writers in this thing, and not a bunch of hacks (Dan Harris, and Michael Dougherty) if the movie makes back its budget, (Which I really doubt!) and is seen worthy of a sequel I hope that Bryan Singer is not brought back, and neither is this cast...

7,Superman Saves the Summer,"This movie was just what I wanted. Escape at its best. From the very beginning there's an excitement in hearing the old John Williams theme, updated quite nicely actually, and in seeing the beginning credits mimic the ones form 25 years ago. This movie certainly respects its predecessors. What's great is that it does so while one-upping them.The beginning is where the film is truly weak. I would have loved to see the whole cornfield and barn scenes work instead at the beginning of the movie as introduction, rather than twenty minutes in as flashback. I hated the written explanation at the beginning of the film. Totally unnecessary.But all is forgiven quite quickly. The cast is gorgeous and Lex is evil, though perhaps just a little boring, but Parker Posey does just wonderful things with her character. The special effects are really unparalleled and above all, the humor is spot on. All these things work together to carry us through the, at times, slow pacing. I trust, though, that Bryan Singer knows what he's doing, using this film to set up number two, giving us lots of characterization, just as he did with X-Men.Regardless, the film is still action packed, and without a single true fight scene. I was literally on the edge of my seat twice; first with the airplane and then again when the White family was trapped on the boat. Loved the maturity and restraint Singer used in storytelling, not exploiting Jason White's big secret and not conveniently killing off the less plot tidy characters. Routh was perfect, absolutely perfect. He took control of the role and really made the film work picking up where others, Bosworth in particular, might have slightly lacked.This was by far the best film of the summer. I can't help but compare it to X-Men 3. This film was FUNNY, made as much SENSE as is possible for a comic book made into a movie, and had a phenomenal score, even memorable. All things the other movie lacked.Why, oh why, wouldn't any studio wait for Singer?",0,2,finding-something,"Jul 15, 2006",

A worthy replacement for the late great Chris Reeve. Spacey as Luthor was an inspired choice. However, I wasn't too sure about Kate bosworths Lois, but this didn't detract from this amazing story. If you loved the originals then i'm sure you will love this. I felt like i was a kid again. Even the opening/end credits and theme tune were kept. When that theme tune piped up, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. The film has more characterisation and you really do get a sense of how super superman is with added special effects. There's even a plot twist which i didn't expect. I can see that singer adapted some of the comic book elements, and the film is more adult based whilst still providing entertainment for the kiddies. One of the best films this year so far, if not thee best, and it rightly takes a place in my top 10 all time greatest films.",0,1,roywilson23,"Jul 16, 2006",

7,Superman Soars or is he just Sore?,"Some 20 years on since the last of the ever-diminishing sequels, Supes returns to revitalise long dead superhero franchise. The original Christopher Reeve incarnation was rightly recognised as one of the 1st feature films to really do justice to a comic superhero.I have to say I was a little deflated by the end, after all how could it live up to the nostalgic memories of a child who really believed a man could fly in 1978? Comic book movies have grown up a great deal in recent years and benefited from the greatest advances special effects and CGI, thereby stealing some of the thunder of this latest superhero entry.The story is very much a re-tread of Reeve's 1st outing, Lex Luthor's plans of creating his own devious ""real estate"" deal (without planning permission!), offing Supes with a dose of radioactive Kryptonite- all along with the help of his ""tart-with-a-heart"" accomplice.I guess I can show some sympathy to Bryan Singer directorial approach- he has to re-establish the franchise as well as make a new film- so that new generations can appreciate it. However, I think they played it a little safe by relying so heavily on the 1978 story template. He does try to make us remember that Superman is actually an ""alien"" and outsider- it does worry me slightly that this fairly clean cut bastion of morality resorts to sneaking about to spy on Lois Lane and family like a Super Stalker! ""I never lie Lois,"" said Reeve in the ""78"" original. Now she can reply ""No. But you do follow me around stalking me with your x-ray vision and super hearing!"" The good news is they have found a great new unknown to play Clark and Superman in Brandon Routh. There is no question that he has similar qualities, mannerisms and speaks in a similar tone to Reeve, without it being a copycat performance. He may not play Clark as such a bumbling fool; here he's a much plainer, ordinary Joe who is a bit of a non-entity. Which makes sense, if you are trying to blend in and avoid public attention! Bosworth plays her part okay, but is too young to convince as a wily reporter.Spacey is under-used to a degree, but carries off the part with some humour and definitely more menace when called for than Hackman did. So he should given his psychotically, impersonal reaction to killing ""billions"" as a direct result of his own ""home grown continent"" experiment! The story and characters are not played with the same level of playfulness and somewhat silly humour we had in the past. This is grounded in a more realistic world. The dialogue can fall a little flat at times and there is not as much intensity to these scenes that the film makers were going for.The special effects are fabulous, and I would like to think that seeing some of it in IMAX 3-D would add to the experience. Superman is as physically strong as you would want him to be and the plane/shuttle rescue highlights this fact very early on. In fact this action sequence is probably the best in the film, and its hard to top.There is one sequence towards the end which evokes stronger emotions, Supes taking on a magnificent feat of strength, whilst putting himself in mortal danger with no thought of the consequences- now thats what hero's are made of! It also cleverly taps into the very real images that will always be remembered from 9/11- the cities population staring in shock at the events unfolding, an ""impact"" causing dirt and dust to travel through the streets and park etc.All in all, I cannot say it blew me away, but I can say that the next one- if directed by Singer- will likely up the ante in the same way ""X2"" did for the 1st X-men movie.With so many recent and decent superhero movies out there (X-men's, Spiderman's and the excellent Batman Begins) this comes in as a Solid 7 out of 10.",1,1,garynorton,"Jul 16, 2006",
6,A little disappointed,"I've always been a fan of superman; comics, cartoons, and the earlier movies with the late Christopher Reeve. I shared the same feelings as any other superman fan out there; I have had a lot of expectations about this film, and a little pessimistic due to Byran Singer's intent. Nevertheless, I was excited and I wanted this movie to do extremely well at the box office. However, I was extremely underwhelmed with Bryan's final work. Come on, with a budget of over 200 million dollars they could have at least added an extra villain to improve the action sequences? I honestly don't see where the money went in production. Yes the movie was shot in high definition, but every fan who had saw the film was hugely disappointed by it with the reused Lex quest for real estate.I read several articles circling the internet that big boys at Warner Brothers are not going to make another sequel unless the movie clock in 200 million dollars in gross profit, domestically. Sadly, I don't think the movie is going to make that much because of Pirates the Caribbean 2, now that is a real summer blockbuster which did pretty well, stealing some of Superman's thunder with 132 million dollars in the first few opening days.It seems I did nothing but say negative views about Superman returns. Nevertheless, it is a well done film that has a lot of fan service for those who loved the first two old movies with Christopher Reeve. Everything from the presentation to the sound was revamped, and the special effects kind of up there. The story, on the other hand, or some the scenes wasn't original. Not even the dialog that was spoken by some of the major cast in the film; hardly any of the dialog was original.Does this movie worth movie ticket admission? Nope, wait until it comes on DVD or on Cable. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is a better option. Hopefully, if there is a sequel, Mr. Bryan will show us something more epic..",1,1,akumous,"Jul 16, 2006",
6,It is forbidden for you to interfere with Hollywood history,"""Where did you go"" Lois asked Brandon Routh's Superman an hour into this Super-sort of Sequel. Development hell, that's where. And there, like a creative phantom zone, he languished for nigh on twenty years. Burton proposed cracking the zone by relieving the man of his power of flight – good idea: Remove the characters one defining characteristic. Ratner also caught the revisionist bug, suggesting such howlers as remaking the first film with a surviving planet Krypton. Thus a sense emerged that there were more Otis' in Hollywood than Lex Luthors and the these geniuses blew $40M trying to work out a viable way of making a new Superman film when the perfect template was languishing in their vaults all the time – available for the cost of a viewing theatre. The name of this obscure super-template? Superman! It took Bryan Singer to work out that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Thus Superman's Return is modelled with an unprecedented level of reverence for a modern remake on Richard Donner's original Reeve duo. As a tribute act it works well enough – Williams music is reused, Jon Barry's design carried over and the plot of the first film is alluded to ever so often so as to create an eery impression we're watching a direct sequel, though this is evidently not quite the case. This means that Returns is neither fair nor foul – a sequel to an imaginary version of Donner's film set in the noughties with this new cast. It requires a collective leap of imagination to work and almost succeeds except that Singer's version fails to capture the warmth and humour of the original films. Routh's performance oscillates between stiff and quietly dignified. He understates his Superman as Reeve did but lacks his predecessor's intelligence, wit and affability. Spacey, replacing Hackman, plays for menace in keeping with the film's more somber tone and presents a Lex more dangerous but possibly too brutal for what essentially should be a family film. Just as Routh's costume favours darker tones than Reeve's, his Superman isn't as colourful. The replicated closing shot of Superman soaring in orbit round the Earth vividly shows the difference between the classic and revival. Reeve looked down on the Earth and smiled, satisfied all was well. Routh replicates the movement but stays straight faced, a cold fish to the end. Singer's love for the material isn't in doubt but somewhere he and his cast have forgotten about the comic in comic book.

9,Fantastic and Well Worth Making,"Last night I went to see Superman Returns with my 7 year old son and my ex-wife. I approached the film with anticipation despite not being the world's biggest Superman fan, as we were going to watch it at the 8 storey high, 1000 stereo equivalent IMAX cinema IN 3D.The version we saw has additional 3D scenes only available in the northwest. There were only two 3D editions released in the UK, one in London and one with the additional scenes in Manchester.I have a few beefs with Superman as a protagonist hero for a start he's too bloody perfect by far, He's invulnerable, he's a bit of a pretty boy and he's all bright and shiny. He can fly, shoot lasers from his eyes etc. He never really suffers except in the presence of Kryptonite, which rather handily is always going to fall into the hands of which ever arch nemesis he happens to battle in any film made about him, which is bound to take away much of the surprise for any viewer.Superman represents an odd dichotomy in that he's more of a symbol than a hero. He stands for truth, justice and err… the American way, aye and therein lies the rub. In these days of Bush, McDonalds and moral uncertainty, can there ever be a (and notice I'm not using the word believable obviously) a relatable Superman character? Well not in the comics to any extent, which doesn't matter so much as due to the particular creative medium, fans of comics have a heightened sense of suspended disbelief. Good comics are analysed as artistic expressions with the plots having as much to do with the characters physical rendering as much as the storyline itself. Good comics that are genre defining are common as the standards set by the industry are high. Great comics that redefine the genre however are rare.Making the new superman film, must have been a real tightrope walk, for Bryan Singer. How does he keep film fans, comic fans, neutrals and movie goers alike all happy?How would you go about making Superman interesting? Well for a start I'd use lots and lots of cutting edge special effects. The bigger, the more magnificent the better, for after all this is the most powerful superhero on the planet bar none so let's go all out.Then I'd concentrate on showing him as 'normal' as possible. Despite the power despite and despite the truer than true blue personality, I'd want to illustrate the doubt that resides in all of us as to the purpose we'd put ourselves too if we had those marvellous powers. I'd show him as an alien alone in a world gone a tad mad and bad, surrounded by media attention and the difficulties in maintaining relationships whether romantic or platonic.Either way I'd want to show that despite his powers the frailties of humanity are what makes Superman truly Super, the fact that despite feeling the same things, anger, passion, jealousy, loneliness etc (the things that make us all truly alike) he uses his position of power to fight evil wherever he finds it. Always, despite his alienation and difference as an individual he still manages to resist temptation and stands up as the best example of a lax intergalactic immigration policy ever.Bryan Singer does some of these things in his film and all in all I'd say it's easily in the same league as it's fore-running predecessors, Blade, Spiderman, Batman Begins and other recent comic films that have brought icons of the 50's and 60'sinto modern day. They've all managed to escape the common pitfalls and mistakes of their original made for TV films and mini-series. They've reinvented characters, whilst staying true to they're core natures and justified their motives and actions in a way that doesn't stick in the craw of a world of nurtured cynics.As much as I wanted light sabre after watching Starwars, much as I wanted a hat and a whip like Indy after seeing Raiders of the lost ark, as much as I wanted to be able to shoot webbing from my wrists after watching Spiderman, as much as I wanted to dress up in black leather and beat people up after Batman. . . ahem we'll stop there. I think you get the picture.Brandon Routh makes a fine Superman easily worthy of the role and after a slew of pallid, just here for the looks female leads, it's about time we had a worthy female lead. Kate Bosworth is great. Also James Marsden plays well a much understated performance in a fine supporting role. I felt he anchored the film emotionally ad that it would have been quite 2 dimensional without him doing it so well.Spacey for me was the weakest link, playing for Pacino like menace but ending up falling just short of camp. He displays none of the charisma that I feel Smallvilles Michael Rosenbaum, perhaps would have brought to the role, but perhaps that was too crossover for Hollywood.Superman Returns is a great interpretation of a classic socio-urban myth, retaining the dignity, slight cheese and lantern jawed rightness of the original hero, but bringing enough 'human' interest as to hold interest of a modern day audience. 8.7 out of 10.",1,2,St00,"Jul 16, 2006",

6,Superman Returns- dazed and confused,"The recent spate of Comic-book action films has now turned full circle. This is most surprisingly the last and also the most overdue considering some recent tripe within the genre (Hellboy, The Punisher et al). Superman has finally arrived, and, starting with excellent extended space-swooping opening credits, entertains a magnificent sense of scope. It is fitting that the king of Superheroes gets a film of such grandiose scale and spectacle, and director Bryan Singer clearly wants to utilise all the resources available, signalling his intentions early, furthered by a breathtaking aeroplane-in-peril rescue sequence around twenty minutes in. Inevitably, in direct contrast to the original film, special effects hold no bounds here, and there are wondrous set-pieces intermittent throughout.However fantastical the CGI however, the curse of the remake and all of it's connotations haunts the film. Singer is caught between the dilemma of whether to keep the theme of the film as simple as possible to appease traditionalists or to extend the intricacies of the plot and give it the modern complexities and sub-stories that todays audiences demand. The concept and attitudes of the characters generally seem dated but their actions belong to a much more contemporary landscape, resulting in a contradictory film which feels ultimately unsure of itself. The majority of remakes are similarly burdened with this fate but there are some notable exceptions, such as Spiderman which is a perfect example of a film of it's type rising above it's station due to the addition of an excellent script. Superman lacks the layered sub-plots combined with the emotional undertow of it's characters present in Sam Raimi's film, so your interest tends to lull between the action. The introduction of Lois Lane's child who may or may not actually be the son of Superman from his previous relationship with her is predictable, and hence this subsidiary becomes tiresome very quickly.The actors do a capable a job as possible with the means at their disposal, and Kevin Spacey turns in a surprisingly modest performance; he resists the temptation to ham his way through and comes out of the film with some credit. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane goes through the motions but she can hardly be blamed and the introduction of her spurned and retaliatory attitude towards Superman (after she had been deserted for 5 years) is well played. The standout performance though is Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman- he effortlessly maintains the fresh-faced, all-American innocence of Reeve and fits snugly into a role for which he now seems the ideal preference, and although he lacks the overall charisma of his predecessor, he does indeed do a good job.Another big disappointment however is the lack of chemistry between the two leads. Symptomatic of the writings inability to fathom anything approaching meaningful, their scenes together are devoid of the same spark and plausible romanticism generated between Reeve and Kidder in the 1978 version. I found myself yawning whenever conversations within the film exceeded a couple of minutes; In these times, we ask for more, and this weakness is indicative of the overall problem. Such a surprise for the same director that crafted the superb Usual Suspects, it is easy to forget that he is hamstrung by the towering influence if the original.These gripes apart, on the whole, Singer has made a relatively entertaining film which will undoubtedly be a big success at the Box Office on either side of the Atlantic, and this, combined with the open-ended denouement will surely provide a(nother) sequel before long. The film isn't without it's strengths, and the sense of something grand surrounds proceedings, but the use of eye-popping CGI coupled with some decent performances just doesn't paper over the cracks.At least with the next picture, if the same production team take on the project, the shackles of the previous effort will provide an opportunity for ascendancy rather than anything else. A motion picture hampered by more insecurities than the Man Of Steel deserves.",4,5,Lpurchase1,"Jul 16, 2006",
3,Reasons why not to see this movie!!!,"Wow, this movie was possibly the worst thing ever put on film!After talking to one of my good friends, he mentioned that i should go and see Superman Returns. While he was telling me about his experience watching this movie I thought to myself well i have to check it out too. The first half an hour or so was alright nothing to entertaining, but then it just dragged on and on and on and on. Into the first hour I counted 15 people walking out of the theater, some were even making negative comments about the film on there way out. I believe this is another movie that should've never been remade. The casting/acting was awful and so was the dialog. It seems Hollywood doesn't even care about what the make theses days. Some of the lines that Superman uses were so lame that i wanted to vomit. Honestly, who in the modern world would use such dumb catch pharses and one liners? Oh i know who a person that works for a major newspaper during the day and cant even pick up a broad. I am talking about Clark Kent's character. Lex Luther's character played by Kevin Spacey was also quite lame. Overall Don't SEE THIS MOVIE, IT WILL ONLY Disappoint YOU>",2,2,luhtamane,"Jul 16, 2006",

10,Bryan Singer Deserves an Oscar,"Bryan Singer's Superman Returns is a masterful restarting of the Superman franchise. While advancing the characters in surprising ways, particularly the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane, the film pays respectful homage to the 1978 classic Superman: the Movie. Think of everything you liked about Richard Donner's film: the quotable script, the mix of humor and spectacle, the antagonistic relationship between hero and villain, then amp it up. Instead of one chunk of Kryptonite there is an island of it; instead of a glance of Noel Neill there is an important scene with her, instead of a near fatal accident/rescue with a helicopter, there is an entire jetliner at risk, etc.Brandon Routh makes a spectacular film debut as the most super-powered yet most poignant Superman ever. Routh's interpretation of the Man of Steel and Clark Kent are wonderfully similar in earnestness to Christopher's Reeve's, yet there is a subtlety in Routh's depiction of the very human, charming Clark Kent that is humorous without being cartoony. The special effects are eye-popping and thrilling. The brutal treatment of Superman by Kevin Spacey's awesomely evil Lex Luthor is nearly terrifying. Superman's unbelievable feats of strength are the stuff of new iconographic imagery. The memorable script by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris is well written and respectful with no cringe-inducing silliness. John Ottman's symphonic score remaking John Williams' music from the '70s is inspiring. New characters like Lois's child Jason and her fiancé Richard White are sensitively played by Tristan Lake Leabu and James Marsden; Parker Posey is highly amusing as Kitty, and Kate Bosworth's Lois has many of the film's best scenes. With stunning art direction and HD cinematography this a terrific and satisfying movie. Superman's cape rippling in the wind is a thing of beauty and so is this movie. Bryan Singer should get an Oscar nomination and he and Brandon Routh should be proud.",1,4,carkent1-1,"Jul 16, 2006",

5,"I really, really wanted to like (even love) this movie.","I really liked many things ABOUT Superman Returns. I think Singer and writers definitely had their heart in the right place with their whole approach to re-starting/continuing the franchise. I loved the old-school feel (including using the old score.) I loved that they didn't make Superman edgy, neurotic, or otherwise post-modern. I loved the '5 years after' premise of the movie, and how they were able to humanize Superman and give his character some great dramatic story material (hard to do with a practically invincible superhero!)Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the actual movie so much. I thought it dragged and didn't really go anywhere, and ultimately failed to deliver on its great potential. After half an hour I was excited, after 2 hours I was wondering if anything significant would really happen. Superman loves Lois. Lois loves Superman. The boyfriend loves Lois. Clark is shy and clumsy. All the elements are in check, ready to go. But then nothing really happens. No one commits to anything or really acts, it felt like all set up and no resolution. Luthor's evil plot was pretty good, but the ending felt anti-climactic to me. I think there were so big missed opportunities that I won't go into since it would involve spoilers.It felt like Singer wanted to set up a trilogy, so used this movie to 'set the stage'. Except 2 and a half hours of stage-setting is a really long time. More judicious editing would have helped here- I think this was a 2-hour movie max. But regardless of the length, I'd much rather have 1 or 2 great movies, than 3 so-so ones.The cast is good on the whole. I liked Brandon Routh, but started getting put off by the underacting thing near the end. But I'd like to see him continue the role. I thought Kate Bosworth was fine, but wonder about the script in regards to Lois. She seemed to change from being bold and independent (in earlier movies) to flighty and contrary. Many people seemed to dislike Bosworth, but I am not sure if it is her shortcoming or the script's. Spacey and Posey were very solid, as expected.There were some really great moments in the movie- when Superman saves the Shuttle and the whole world welcomes him back, and also what happens when Luthor faces Superman. And if they make a sequel, I will watch it in the theater. But while I loved what they tried to do with Superman Returns, unfortunately the actual movie was a mixed experience for me.",0,1,steveylang,"Jul 16, 2006",
6,What happened?,"I thought this was going to be great. The return of Superman. After all how could it fail to beat Superman IV: The Quest For Peace? I don't grumble at every movie that is released, but the story and plot were confused and made little sense. Little emotion was conveyed through the characters and an original John Williams score absent. (John Ottman filling in for him). It does have some good special effects but with a budget this huge, you'd expect it. It has a missing charm and magic, perhaps that was the late Christopher Reeve. The cast feel too young. One of the elder actors, Kevin Spacey, did a good job as Lex Luthor though, very menacing, if a little camp. But hey, that's what Superman is.""See you in 20 years said Superman at the end of Quest For Peace"" Well it's been 19, I could have held out for 20.Peter",1,1,peter_lumley,"Jul 16, 2006",
6,Super Man - Shocking Script,"Brandon Routh, the new superman, puts in a great deal of effort and portrays the essence of the character very well comparing favourably to the superman of the past Christopher reeves. Unfortunately the mega budget and good acting is seemingly wasted on a weak plot line and bad scripting... As it has been said in the past you can make a bad film out of a good script but not a great film out of a bad one - again this is the case.Due credit should and indeed must be given to Routh though as he fills the role as perfectly and proves to be a talented actor. The shoes he had to fill were super in so many ways as was his predecessor Reeves and HE unlike the script manages not to disappoint.### All in all not a great movie but regardless it will have very good success in the box offices and is worth watching just to see Superman back in the sky's once again###",1,1,jazza-uk,"Jul 16, 2006",

3,The writers of this movie should have been fired,"This is summer time. Many people are on holidays while many other keep working despite of the hot weather. In both cases, many of us need a moment to go and offer our brains a moment of rest with some typical summer flick, i.e. a movie we hope to be not too complicated but quite entertaining. Good action, hilarious jokes or sweet stories usually make it. Alas, some movie writers, probably hurried to go for their own holidays, decide to write a dull script with haste and let the producers design nice advertisements (posters, trailers...) so that summer moviegoers get fooled and pay their tickets. Superman Returns is a typical example of those ""works"".Let's summarize very shortly. After looking for remains of his home planet, Superman returns to Earth. He obviously finds back his former love Lois while an evil character prepares...his dramatically evil plans. So far so good: we expect a mix of a (not too complicated) love story and a (not too complicated) action/superhero story. The movie is 2 1/2 hour long, so there is pretty much room for both aspects: you say ""this is going to be a great summer flick"". Well, not! I am probably unfair, but I had the feeling that the action only lasted about 1/2 hour, and the problem that I am not too keen on love stories, or at least on that much simplified (simplistic?) ones. So, I had to bear what seemed to be 2 hours of Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane turning around in a very stupid, dull and unconvincing way. Actually, all the ""sentimental"" part of Superman Returns could have been shrunk to what was left to the action part, that's to say, half an hour. The movie would have been then much more equilibrated and entertaining, and my friends and I would not have felt totally conned.Now, I have to admit that the movie had one good point: Kevin Spacey was the perfect fit for the arrogant and maniac Lex Luthor character. The 3 points I give to the movie go to him. The other main actors, as dull and smooth as Barbie and Kent dolls, only deserve to fall in the Hollywood oblivion.",1,1,detectivenishi,"Jul 16, 2006",
6,"Yet another remake, but it IS Superman:","I watched in anguish this summer as our nation's big screens were over-inundated yet again with a plethora of sequels and remakes. What should I see first? Superman was my role model of choice as a youngster, whether it be the George Reeves or Christopher Reeve version. I admired and looked up to both actors, as they both gave a touch of their own personality and artistic flavor to whom the Man of Steel was supposed to be. I'm a bit disappointed in Brandon Routh, as he seemed to be more of a copycat of Reeve than anything else.A movie with so much potential was thankfully not full of the average clichés that tend to destroy most sequels and remakes, but this one didn't quite have enough originality to make the cut. There is one cliché involved, though, that most are hailing as the greatest pot twist ever.Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lex Luthor, and the toothbrush scene is the one that will forever be emblazoned on my mind. He's not quite Gene Hackman, though, and it is unfortunate that Spacey has to compete with one of the greatest bad-guy character players of all time when attempting this role. Spacey just about makes the cut.I wasn't impressed with Kate Bosworth's portrayal of Lois Lane, and Richard White's (James Marsden) relationship with her was just not believable.I will give Bryan White some kudos, though. The intro to the movie, with the stock footage of Marlon Brando, was definitely well done. Not much was changed from the original with a slight exception of juicing up the intro credits. I thought I was going back in time to 1979 where I watched the first Superman, and its awesome intro special effects, for the first time on the big screen.When it comes down to it, though, this is just another remake, albeit a well done one. However, it is Superman. That is what leads me to give it an above average grade.",1,1,bkautzman,"Jul 16, 2006",

7,So-so reintroduction of an old friend,"I have to say that Superman Returns was not as bad as some have said and certainly not as good as others have. I'll admit, Superman I and II were hard acts to follow and so my disappointment may have something to do with unrealistic expectations.On the plus side, this movie had casting down pat. All of the actors were great for their roles and their performances made the movie work better than it would have otherwise.That having been said, they were given some pretty good stuff to work with. Not perfect, but good. I recall groaning out loud when I saw that Lois Lane had a kid, but the good folks in charge (director and writers) never once pulled a lame-o kid moment ala ""The Mummy Returns"" when junior declares, ""My dad's gonna kick your a**."" The interpersonal relationship between Lois and Clark was kept real and I only wish they had spent more time on it.Which brings us to the bad points. I can see why they did it, but I wish they hadn't. The filmmakers threw a great big world-threatening plot by Lex Luthor into what was otherwise an entertaining yarn about the incredibly complex situation that Superman finds himself in when he returns after an unannounced five year hiatus. Sure a movie without a villain threatening to blow the world to bits may have been too story-driven, too character-driven, too intelligently entertaining, but, you gotta get the kids in there somehow. I just wish they had managed to mesh the two story lines together a little more seamlessly, because to be quite frank, Luthor's whole plot seemed a little too last minute for my tastes.But, someone, somewhere decided that they needed to waste a whole bunch of time re-introducing us to a man all of us should know and love by now. I did find myself entertained by it, just not as much as I had hoped. That having been said, I do hope they make more and what better tribute could there be to Christopher Reeve than to continue entertaining millions with the character he helped make come alive?",0,2,dog_fc,"Jul 16, 2006",

So many let downs with Hollywood chucking loads of remakes that just embarrass themselves more. Then you get the sequels or maybe horror films with CGI's which just DON'T work.However, this film does and it does it in style.I don't think it is as good as Superman 2 but it's good. Great effects for a start that look and sound great. The acting roles all fill in well and what a difficult task to wear the cape of the late Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey I thought was superb. His evil nature that lay dormant under a disturbingly intelligent and crazy individual, he played the part with brilliance.Don't think there's much more to say and there can't be when there are only minor flaws such as a few holes in the storyline but it doesn't matter.One thing I did notice and that was a couple of young kids with those smiles on their faces after the show. Took me back to when I first saw Superman as child with my family. Come to think of it, I also saw a few elderly people there as well and that was interesting as you don't get many going to the cinema in my area.

And the Crystal's what got dropped they are Superman's father's you cannot leave it on a cliff hanger like this the director is probably one of the best Clark should be in the sequel Louise should stay with her man and Clark's kid should no his heritage super man should teach him how to do all the stuff he had to learn how many years it took him but it will be easier for the kid because he has got his daddy superman at his side.Lex Luther should be back Kevin spacey he has played the best one so far and the effect's are amazing where Clark lift's the big island and throws it into space.well and truly the best film ever,8,6,anthony-quinn,"Jul 17, 2006",

Noel Neil, the original Lois, plays a dying woman in the beginning of the film, and Jack Larsen, the original Jimmy, plays a bartender and has an interesting dialog with the current Jimmy. Of course, for such an expensive film, the special effects are awesome but the plot more than keeps up with the FX so that you get the feeling of watching a real story unfold rather than a collection of computer geek extravaganzas. Brandon Roush, where do they come up with these unknowns?, is good in the role and is reminiscent of a Reeve, especially when he plays bumbling Clark Kent. Kevin Spacey probably plays the best Lex Luthor in Superman history, eclipsing Gene Hackman from the Reeve movies. Kate Bosworth has been updated from clinging female to modern woman but keeps the movie moving along nicely.

There were throwbacks to the original movies of course, some references were made to previous movies for the sake of consistency.Verbal Kint's Lex Luthor is just the right amount of evil for Supermans nemesis, Kevin Spacey gave Lex a sense of weight and danger to the plot.I'm now off to see it again.",2,3,gary_brennan,"Jul 17, 2006",

I think to liven this up it needed more jaw dropping sequences such as that. However upon more thought I realised that this is called ""Superman Returns"" for a reason.This movie is to set the foundation for the upcoming sequels. He disappeared for five years and everyone has learned to cope without him. This whole movie is mainly about him repairing his relationships and re-establishing himself into human society. The whole Lex thing is more of a side story which I didn't really enjoy but Kevin Spacey does do a good job as always.The music was awesome.

9,My Mission: To Save Superman Returns,"It seems that for some reason this movie is not getting the respect and viewership that it deserves. While a drunken Pirate (now please note I am not saying that Pirates of the Caribbean is not a good movie) smashes box office records, no one is going to see a movie about a cultural icon and a true hero, not to mention a good movie. So I have taken it upon myself to save Superman Returns, or at least try to get the point across that it is a good movie that anyone can enjoy. I am simply going to say, being a Superman fan, that I really enjoyed this movie. However I am not a homer when it comes to the things that I like. I can be critical, when being critical is required. However I don't have many things critical to say about this movie. Sure it starts a little slowly. But once it gets started it is a great ride with good acting, great special effects,and great action. Yes, Christopher Reeve was Superman, but that doesn't mean that Brandon Routh doesn't do a good job as Superman. He is just a different Superman. Just like, in my opinion, Sean Connery was the best James Bond, I still enjoy the other people that were James Bond. The rest of the cast is very good, including Kate Bosworth, who I was a bit skeptical of at first. This movie is for everyone. It actually has twists that old and new fans of the Superman can enjoy, and you really will believe that a man can fly. In this time when people need heroes, and our world and our movies seem full of villains and ""anti-heroes"" Superman Returns is a movie that shows us a true hero, regardless of if he is a fictional character or not, and we see him in a great movie.",18,18,JSM15859,"Jul 17, 2006",
6,"A worthy, if slightly unnecessary, addition to the series.","Superman is undoubtedly the most loved and well known superhero ever to grace the big screen. I have never been a great fan personally, but the return of such an iconic figure promises a higher than average quality summer blockbuster, as well as raising the bar on the recent spate of big-screen superhero appearances, which has, in my opinion, largely only produced slightly above average films (the only exceptions being Batman Begins and Spiderman 2).I remember watching the original films as a kid, and as the credits rolled at the start of Superman Returns I felt shivers down my spine as the familiar John Williams theme tune pounded out during the opening credits. Bryan Singer has been very sensible with this film, essentially changing very little in terms of formula, but taking full advantage of the recent developments in technology to create a more satisfying portrayal of kypton's favourite son. That said, you have to wonder whether the whole exercise is worth it, when so little is added to the superman story.After a five year hiatus, searching for the remains of his ancestor's civilisation, Superman returns to earth to find things have moved on a little in his absence. The people of earth have had to cope without their saviour and their anger is given a voice through Louis Lane and her Pulitzer winning article 'Why the world doesn't need Superman'. She is in denial, of course. The world needs Superman, and so does she. Despite having a fiancé and young child, her heart belongs to her ex-colleague Clark Kent's world famous alter-ego.Which leads us on to the most pressing question; does Brandon Routh compare to Superman's most famous recent portrayal by Christopher Reeve? Overall, Routh does a great job filling Reeve's shoes. He certainly looks the part, and as Superman he conveys that sense of strength and protection that lies at the heart of the character. The script, however, gives him few opportunities to stretch himself, particularly when he is disguised as Clark Kent. As Kent he comes across as a little dull, and is less successful at capturing the bumbling comedy than Christopher Reeve. Other performances are also a little lacking; Kate Bosworth offers nothing to hold the attention, and Kevin Spacey is given little chance to stretch his crazy muscle, which is a shame, because Spacey as Lex Luthor was one of the main draws of the film for me.In terms of action, effects and spectacle, the film succeeds on most levels. Seeing Superman fly is more breathtaking than ever. As he drifts through the city, pierces the clouds and leaves the earth's atmosphere, he is now more graceful and enjoyable to watch than ever. Most of the action sequences are spot on, particularly the plane crash early in the film, which ends in the sort of American grandstanding that one expects from this hero. Much of the excitement toward the end of the film hits the right buttons, although I found the final showpiece to be excessive and a little unimaginative.Despite its shortcomings, Superman Returns marks a clear return to form for the series after the massively flawed third and fourth additions to the series. The film is directed with confidence and ease by Singer, and Superman may have found a new face with Routh. In terms of a cinematic event, it doesn't really get much more exciting, as Superman once again sweeps Louis off her feet, catches some large things before they crush people, and rockets around the world (apparently faster than a speeding bullet) saving all and sundry. The film offers nothing new, but perhaps it was time to see Superman back where he belongs, dominating the summer blockbuster schedule.",0,0,duvallpj,"Jul 17, 2006",
10,"SR is Movie Perfection!  Thank you Bryan, Brandon, Kate, and WB!","SR is Movie Perfection! Thank you Bryan, Brandon, Kate, and WB! After two more viewings last weekend (including 1st time in IMAX), I've now see SR five times. I may be a little obsessed, but who can blame me? It's just that good. I've never - ever - seen another movie in theaters five times (and only once before saw one four times).I truly LOVE this film and enjoy it even more with each new viewing. It's like movie nirvana from beginning to end. Everything about this film is perfect to me: the story, the direction and feel of the film, the visuals and effects, the music, the action, the romance, and especially Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman. It's exciting, fun, engrossing, entertaining, and very satisfying.I've been a long time fan of the original Superman movies (well, not so much 3 of 4) and both the Lois & Clark and Smallville TV series. I've also loved all of the actors who've played CK/SM, especially Chris Reeve, but Brandon is absolutely perfect. His look, his voice, his acting, and just the physical presence he brings the character are simply amazing. As others have said, I think he was born for this role, and we viewers are blessed that he was chosen and that he put so much effort and heart into really being Superman.Bryan Singer's story, vision and direction resulted in a movie that will forever be close to my heart. The film is breathtakingly beautiful and deeply engrossing. It's a very moving and emotional story. I can't take my eyes off the screen and the 2.5 hour run time flies by as fast as Superman himself.Kate also did a very good job as Lois. Her whole performance was great, but she sold me with the look on her face as she hid her true feelings after she told Superman on the rooftop that she didn't need him anymore.I can't wait to buy the DVD(s), and I'm hopeful there will be an extended directors cut version with the omitted scenes of Clark's trip to Krypton and the additional scenes on the Kent farm. I'm even more hopeful that there will be several blockbuster sequels in the coming years. Thank you to everyone who was involved with making this movie a reality.",26,14,rkorte1,"Jul 17, 2006",

2,This Superman does not fly,"I have never been a Superman fan. Sorry, but I can not relate to him just because I was born and raised on Planet Earth and to get the Super attached is something I will never get. Yet, when Warner delivered their 1978 movie, I really enjoyed the film. So I did in 1980 with the second part, which by the way is one of those rare pictures that are better than the first one. I was 15 at that time. 26 years later, you would expect an improvement, don't you ? I mean, Christopher Reeve was not exactly the Actor of his generation, in fact, it seemed that his acting coach was a brick from the Brooklyn Bridge. Well Brandon Routh, makes Christopher Reeve look like Marlon Brando compared to him.He is plain, and boring and his acting on screen seems as fake as his eye contacts. Also Bosworth is disappointing as Lois Lane, and certainly you would expect more from Kevin Spacey but his Lex Luthor is more dull and never seems threatening or capable to inspire fear in any sense. It looks like a Hackman's Luthor decaffeinated. The main problem is that Singer tried too hard to have this superman more humanized, and yet as a Mesias (Brando's voice over: I sent you my only son to guide them etc.... )Even in some takes he resembles a cross (Sam Reimi already did that with Spidey in part II with much better results). The special effects also are not astounding at all. The aerial sequence in King Kong was far better done, than any on this movie, and also any Harry Potter/Narnia /Lord of the Rings has more creative effects also. The only two aspects that are outstanding in this movie are the main Titles and the Music. Taken directly from the 78 movie, they are the only reason why I gave this flop its two stars.",0,1,pacmanmty,"Jul 17, 2006",

10,Superman Returns is Phenomenal!,"Go out and see this movie it is Phenomenal, it is very reminiscent of the old Christopher Reeve movies. This film will make you laugh and cry, it is a very enjoyable experience.Bryan Singer did a really excellent job with this film, it was both a fitting tribute to both Christopher Reeve and Marlon Brando.This film was dedicated to the Memory of Christopher and Dana Reeve. It was not dedicated to Marlon Brando, however using the old footage was a small dedication in itself.This film plays off as a sequel to Superman: The Movie and Superman II, however it doesn't clearly ignore the other two sequels. Bryan Singer was absolutely correct with his comment ""If Smallville is superman for you this movie will work, if the Christopher Reeve movies are Superman for you this movie will still work"". I tend to think this movie leans more towards the Christopher Reeve movies than Smallville, however there were small moments that did make you think of Smallville a little bit.Kevin Spacey gives a very good performance as Lex Luthor, he was definitely more evil than Gene Hackman, however at times Spacey proved like Routh to be reminiscent of his Predecessor. Overall see this movie you will not be disappointed, go out and rent or buy the DVD!I had to update this commentary by saying that there are far too many arrogant people on IMDb giving this movie negative reviews that are entirely uncalled for. The Message boards for this film are purely a disgrace and I would not waste my time responding to the smut that has been placed there. The negative comments I have been reading about this film are all biased and are apparently being placed by people who are quite narrow-minded and can't seem to see or understand the big picture of it all.

5,Not as super as I expected,"I was surprisingly disappointed in this film. Kevin spacey was great (wow, there's a shock - not. I actually liked him in K-Pax!!) I thought the actor playing Clark Kent/Superman was good, but I thought Bosworth was a very weak link in the ""Lois' legacy. Lois is a spitfire -always ready to move, take an action, be involved. But I thought Bosworth's presentation was too reserved, too 'careful.' Rather than being pro-actively involved, I felt like Bosworth's ""Lois"" was dragging her feet, waiting to react - and then react very, very slowly, kind of like the way a person will run on slick ice. There might be motion, but the motion doesn't actually move the person forward gracefully or effectively. I also thought that the storyline was...pointless. Lex Luthor is being a pain - that's not new. Lex is out for revenge - that's not new. What, in my opinion, SHOULD have been the focus was the conflict between Lois and Superman - but there didn't seem to be any at all. Rather than dealing with their feelings, they seemed to gloss over them. ""Oh, my heart was broken, now your back, let's have a chai latte!"" There is no back story as to either why Superman left, what he did while he was gone, or how he felt about his discoveries (they summed up the entire adventure in about 2 sentences), or how he felt about his return. And because the discord wasn't there, neither was there an effective resolution, in my opinion. Visually, the film was as beautifully done as any I've ever seen, but the pace was pokey and overly drawn-out. The actions sequences were REAL heart-thumpers, but they were not in any way the focus of the movie, and only provided momentary breaks in the tedium. Superman, you may have returned, but frankly, I'm sticking with Smallville.",4,5,acts2120,"Jul 17, 2006",
1,Superdud,"In my opinion this had to be one of the worst superhero films of all time. First, the cast selection was completely inappropriate. The feel here was like watching a brat pack movie. The entire cast was either too young, or just appeared and acted as such. Not one of the characters fit the bill as prescribed by the long history of comics and/or features preceding this flop.Superman/Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) was the worst fit of them all. Many other reviews have supported the age problem and many have stated that Routh was much too young for the role. The truth is that he is exactly the same age as was Christopher Reeve when he first appeared as the man from Krypton. However, Christopher Reeve was much more of manly figure with a more distinguished look, demeanor, and appeal. Though Routh could probably do well in a Teen-Beat magazine, he just can't escape his boyish persona and most likely will never match the Charisma of Reeve.Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) also appeared much too young for the role in general, but also for the time frame for which this specific story is set. Her role and performance were nothing like the busy-body, always pressed for the scoop, reporter that Lois Lane has become known for.Perry White and Jimmy Olsen couldn't have been worse either. I just have to ask... What were the casting crew thinking? Or better yet, what were they smoking? Obviously they didn't do their homework on the characters of this legendary hero story and made a feeble attempt at creating the lineup.Now as for Kevin Spacey, I like the guy a lot and believe him to be a multi-talented performer. However, when I look at him in this film, I just can't see the sinister genius, Lex Luther. Maybe it was the directing, or again, just a bad fit for the part, but he just didn't cut it as Luther.The plot was terribly weak and the story itself was nothing more than shallow. Furthermore, the 2.5 hours of film time was pathetic and filled with little more than fluff. There was nothing to this film that couldn't have been shown in a substantially reduced time frame. In contrast, Saturday morning cartoons have more story and appeal than this product, and get more action across in a half hour versus the way too lengthy time period here. All in all, I believe it to be clear that this film was entirely slopped together for some quick bucks and relied purely on the premise that the public would jump at the opportunity to see Superman on the silver screen once more.The last disappointment in a long list was the Superman costume. First, you can't tell if the thing is supposed to be some type of leather, plastic, or rubber. Regardless, my opinion is that it looked ridiculous and is a failed attempt to bring Superman to the new millennium. Additionally, the effect of making the ""S"" on his chest and belt into dimensional objects was equally ridiculous. The product in whole looks more like something someone would wear to some wild sex party.Aside from some fair CGI, the entire film was a waste of their time and my money. For all those who haven't seen this film yet, rest assured that it won't take long to make it to DVD and ultimately to the cheap sales bin. Unless you just like to throw your money away, wait!11/28/06: Now the DVD is out and by it's initial price alone, proves what a dud this film was for the public. I stopped in the local Walmart to shop and passed by the display for this product. The price... a whopping $13, a value much cheaper than most films of lessor names. It's unfortunate that after almost 20 years since the last Superman film, this one did little to rekindle the story's flame.",9,8,mike-2195,"Jul 17, 2006",

I also think the TV show (with Terry Hatcher) was more interesting to watch. The plot of this movie is a little boring and things are too predictable and obvious. I also have to admit that the special effects and action scenes aren't the best i've seen. There are also too many scenes in the dark which makes the movie 'heavy'.

8,Highly entertaining comic book movie,"Superman Returns director Bryan Singer is fast becoming something of an authority of the whys and wherefores of adapting comic books for the big screen. His hugely successful stabs at the X Men franchise produced two of the genre's high points and with Superman Returns, he once again demonstrates his unique ability to transfer characters and stories from page to screen yet still be able to bend story lines to his whim without angering the salivating Internet fan-boys for whom the phrase ""artistic licence"" is tantamount to racism. Yes, his dream of crafting a Superman film is another impressive title to add to the CV and sends a clear message that X-Men 2 was no fluke.Taking place five years after Superman 2 (and completely ignoring the lacklustre third and fourth entries into the series), the film sees Superman returning (obviously) to earth after a long trip into space to seek out the remains of his home planet. Arriving back in New York and reprising his hidden identity as the journalist Clark Kent, he finds that while the world is still in as much chaos as when he first arrived, his one-time squeeze Lois Lane has moved on to a new lover (James 'Cyclops' Marsden no less) and had a son in his absence. Initially, he tries to lead a quiet life but soon, events conspire to force him to don the iconic costume and fight for truth and justice once more which is incredibly well-timed given that Lex Luthor is lurking just round the corner with yet another Armageddon-inducing scheme.And from the pulse-pounding air-rescue to the jaw-dropping finale, the film delivers on it's promise as perfect summertime entertainment. Thankfully resisting the urge to reinvent the man of steel by adding too much darkness, it succeeds precisely because it knows what it is; a sequel, not a remake. As such, it stays faithful to the tone of the original and retains its sense of charm while the benefit of a twenty year advance in the field of special effects ensures that this is still a film for the X-Box generation.One of the best decisions Singer has made of course is by re-using the incredibly-hummable John Williams soundtrack. Blasting out the cinema speakers with the full power of twenty-first century sound, it evokes the square-jawed melodrama necessary to maintain the atmosphere as we cheer on our new hero. Listening to it again twenty years since the S man last graced cinemas serves as a reminder as to how good it really was all that time ago.Not that Superman Returns is all misty-eyed nostalgia mind you as we now have a brand new hero to cheer on. The previously unknown Brandon Routh makes for an ideal successor to his forerunner Christopher Reeve, striking just the right balance between muscle-bound indestructibility and the bumbling likability of his secret identity. Occasionally he has a second or two where a rabbit-in-the-headlights expression crosses his face as if the enormity of the acting job he's taken on has just occurred, but otherwise the man is perfectly cast. Plus, just to add sugar to the cake, he even looks like Reeve...And then we have Kevin Spacey who is clearly having an absolute whale of a time playing a maniacal super-villain. Striding around in a series of increasingly ridiculous wigs and blessed with lines like ""Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and don't share their power with mankind,"" his role as Lex Luthor is another piece of inspired casting that makes you want to promote someone. Come to think of it, only Kelsey Grammar as Beast in the last X Men movie makes more sense.True, the movie isn't entirely made out of diamonds as Superman comes across as a bit too much like a stalker in one scene and Lois Lane is granted way more screen time than the character deserves, but these are small gripes in what is otherwise an excellent movie. Plus, as Luthor has very few expendable henchmen, the biggest set pieces come from battles against the elements which makes a pleasant change from the usual comic-book scraps against evil versions of the title characters. And while some may be put off by the lack of explanation for Superman's back-story, this is still a thrilling epic that barely feels like two hours, never mind the actual running time which is just shy of three.

But for all that, it still goes a long, long way toward resurrecting a previously comatose DC Comics franchise.There were some quibbles to be had with the film, to be sure - in fact, some quibbles that many had with BB last summer. For one, there are many things that you would think Superman would know better than to do that he goes ahead and does anyway. Now, last summer's Batman did the same thing, but here's the big difference - Bruce Wayne was just then starting out as Batman, whereas Clark Kent has been Superman for quite some time at this point. Truly he should have a better grasp on certain laws of physics than he seems to.All complaints aside, though, this movie was brilliant.

7,Vote 'Yes' for Superman,"I'm nostalgic, and a big fan of the original films, so it would simply be against my very being to give this film a rating lower than 7 out of 10. And in fact I enjoyed the film enough to genuinely warrant that score, but there were some slippery moments! Everyone else has mentioned it so I won't linger on the point, but I'm repeatedly frustrated by the casting of actors in the wrong role for their age - and Loise Lane in this instance is a perfect example. Kate Bosworth is very attractive, and looks good on screen, but the fact is that when the film was shot she was barley 23 and she looks every inch of it. I just can't buy into her as Lois Lane; she's far, far too young. This film is supposed to be 5 years after the 1st and 2nd films. Margot Kidder was 29 when they shot those films. The maths speak for themselves.Perry White was nothing like Jackie Cooper's incarnation in the '78 films. Everything about the character is different. Frank Langella's 'White' is calm, softly spoken and looks more like a CEO than a Newspaper 'Chief'. I also felt that Jimmy Olsen was miscast, he just didn't look or feel right.On the plus side, as most everyone else has stated, Brandon Routh makes a very good Superman and an even better Clark Kent. A very good choice to follow-up Christopher Reeve. Reeve was a very hard act to follow, and I think this brave casting choice really works.A good film, worth watching and if you're a fan of the Superman films then you will enjoy it.

5,Superman doesn't fly high,"Man of Steel new adventure glides without energy, thought, Brian Singer's direction has style and strength.After waiting more than 10 years Superman fifth adventure has finally arrived to our screens. But this new movie hasn't got any kind of charm. And more important, ""Superman Returns"" doesn't invite anybody to dream as the original movie. The weakest point of this movie is its screenplay. And the reason-why is the overlong preproduction of this movie, that involved many directors from Tim Burton, to Kevin Smith or Wolfang Petersen. At the end, the screenplay was written by two many hands and the story lost his sense.On other hand, Brian Singer is a good director. He has enough sense of style and humor to make a good Superman adventure. As the director of X-Men 1 & 2, Singer proved as a good blockbuster director and more important, his movie had fine screenplays full of intelligence and humor. Superman Returns flacks both: the movie has a poor sense of humor (a childish humor) and absolutely no intelligence. Worst, the movie has a confused plot between a family drama, romance story and adventure.The other weak point is starring Brandon Ruth as the new Superman actor. The 26 years-old actor doesn't have the same irony and spicy humor as Christopher Reeve, the first and eternal Superman in the big screen. But, the worst cast selection is Lois Lane actress performance Kate Bosworth. The young actress (she is only 23) doesn't communicate the same power and energy as the original Lois Lane (starred by Margot Kidder). These two cast mistakes are forgiven by the excellent Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor performance. The Academy-Award winner makes a histrionic performance, full of humor and sympathy with the audience.The excellent visual effects, art direction, original score, cinematography are the strong point of this vain adventure that the director, Brian Singer, uses with intelligence and extraordinary splendor (like a movie with a 260$ millions budget).

The body language, the voice inflections - everything was perfect.The movie followed the traditional Superman format, was fairly restrained with it's use of CGI, and was great fun from start to finish.

If your going to make a modern Superman film why not lose the cape? All it does is flap around doing nothing much like the supporting cast. Routh is a good superman and could easily demand millions for a follow up. But the film is flat it lacks the emotional depth of say Spiderman, yes it has amazing CGI but that aside not much else. People are talking about Kevin Spacey's turn as Lex Luther but it is his dim-witted partner in crime Kitty (Parker Posey) who steals the show, she has all the best lines and preens her way excellently throughout all her scenes. The main thing wrong with superman is that there is nothing new here, I know technically it's a remake/new-version so there can't be, but everything here has been seen a hundred times before. Singer's inner geek/fan-boy lets him add some nice little touches like Marlon Brando as superman's dad (despite the fact he's dead!) but he also nicks bits from Titanic, The Matrix and even Batman Begins. It also uses probably the most overused cliché in cinema the 'sleeping beauty affect' and it is just lazy film-making and cheese of the highest order. The plane set piece is amazing to behold just like the rex fight was in King Kong, but it is also a let down because it leaves you with a feeling of what could have been. Sadly this is one off those films where all the best bits are either in the trailer or that advert for piracy you get before any film. Something just doesn't feel right about it, it lacks the edge that a superhero movie should have. Superman returns then but not with a bang.",0,0,come2whereimfrom,"Jul 19, 2006",

10,Superman Returns and Brandon Routh,"As they say the ""man of steel"", well this film was 100% solid. Superman was played outstandingly by Brandon Routh. I thought his performance was brilliant and i could see and hear Christopher Reeve in him. His mannerisms were exactly like the original Superman. His arch enemy Lex Luther was funny as well as evil played by Kevin Spacey. He was great and able to continue the role that Gene Hackman played similar to that of Brandon and Christopher. Both actors were playing off each others reactions with great conviction and I hope they create another film based on this one.Well Done to all involved in the film * * * * * * * * * * 10 out of 10",1,1,danmillenmoviefanatic,"Jul 19, 2006",

5,"Good, but not even close to Great.","The first thing that comes to mind when I think of this movie is the word: ""unexpected."" What was it exactly that the audience weren't totally expecting? Well, the Superman suit, which was revealed for sometime before the release of the movie, was a disaster. The colors are darker, and for the first time ever: Superman's cape looks like my shower curtain! Performances by the characters were sub-par. Probably the one who played his character best was Kevin Spacey. That may be a shock to those who haven't watched the movie yet; but in all honesty, Brandon Routh wasn't as good of an actor as I expected him to be. Maybe the script just didn't call for believable acting. I don't know.Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane? First off, don't expect the same Lois Lane from the 70's movies. Nope. This one is far removed from the Lois we have came to know and love from the comics. That is not good, at least not the way Bryan Singer did it. Bosworth is emotionless, bland, and acts like she doesn't really want to be in the movie all that much.The action? That is the redeeming quality of the movie. The action sequences are few and far between, but for example: the airplane action was great! Superman must save both a space-shuttle and airplane from exploding and killing all the passenger within. I must say, this whole scene was what made me think this movie was 'good'.But in truth: the story is plodding, not believable (in a bad way), and has no real color or pizazz. The greatest controversy comes from the fact that Superman has a son ... SUPERMAN HAS A SON! And not a very good one at that: Jason is sickly, weak, and well, just plain weird.Bryan Singer, I was kind to you and very lenient in giving this movie a '5/10'. God knows it didn't deserve a 6.

5,Superman Re-hashed,"We've waited for this film for a while now... Superman IV: The quest for peace finished filming in 1986. 20 years is a long time to wait. I wanted to love Superman Returns, but essentially it should have been called Superman Remade, or Superman Re-Hashed. It's simply a remake of Richard Donner's Superman (1978) Almost scene for scene in some cases. Dubed by bored critics as a ""requel"" I have to reluctantly agree, Singer does the fundamentals well, the action sequences particularly the Plane crash sequence are breathtaking, the love story between Lois Lane & Superman has been suitably complicated (for the sake of a sequel) although at times slightly 'soapy', there is fine line between a motion picture event and a two and half hour episode of ""Lois & Clark: The new adventures of Superman"". The cast had big shoes to fill and have acquitted themselves expertly; Routh copy's enough of the Reeve mannerisms and charm to get away with it. Bosworth is a more fragile Lois Lane but being decent eye-candy manages to see her through. Both have bright futures. Spacey does his textbook No #43 bad guy routine effortlessly with a special mention for the scene stealing Parker Posey.However I believe Singer and team chose to wrap themselves up in the mythology and popularity of the franchise and have robbed us of a chance of a NEW interpretation of a beloved superhero.",0,0,Established1981,"Jul 19, 2006",

8,A very good effort,"When I first went to see Superman Returns I have to admit my expectations were not very high. As many have realized there have been a lot of big budget movies that have been lacking (Poseidon, Xmen3 etc). I was greatly surprised though, the movie is definitely one of the best of the year. Bryan Singer, the mastermind behind the first two Xmen movies, has definitely proved himself as one of the best directors toady. He without a doubt did not squander the 260 million dollars he was given to shoot the movie creating a great film. Additionally the casting is excellent with Brandon Routh in his first main Hollywood role. Routh is almost identical with his portrayal of Superman/Clark Kent to Christopher Reeve. However the greatest strength of this movie is without a doubt the visual effects. The effects in this movie are so unbelievable, the filmmakers find the equilibrium of effects not over the top like Matrix Reloaded but completely realistic. The storyline in the movie is not the most elaborate but still good enough to keep the attention of the audience. Overall the movie is very good and is recommended for anyone action movie buff.",0,1,jetsguyty,"Jul 19, 2006",

9,Superman Returns is a great sequel to Superman II,"This review does NOT contain spoilers. There is nothing in this review that is not in the trailers.I was surprised by the amount of references to the 1978 movie, there is no doubt that this film was not just an homage to Richard Donner's film(s)…Superman Returns is a bonafide sequel to Superman: The Movie & Superman II! The cinematic abortions that were Superman III & IV can now be wiped from memory. This film is the real Superman III.And in making an actual sequel I think Bryan Singer pulled off a pretty difficult task.In order to re-introduce Superman to a new generation, he had to essentially rehash some of the old plot points from I and II, throw in the Superman lore basics, yet still manage to make a movie that felt fresh, taking a slightly different spin on the old threads, and introducing some new ones…all set years after the events of I and II.In the end I think Singer pulled it off…but there's no way he can afford to try that again.The next Superman movie should now be free to be a completely new story altogether, a proper sequel to Superman Returns with no more need for concrete ties to Donner's original.As for the actors, Brandon Routh was great…and at times he looked and sounded eerily like Christopher Reeve. They were difficult boots to step into but Routh handled it perfectly.Kate Bosworth on the other hand wasn't as perfect a fit for Lois as Routh was for Superman. While she's nicer to look at…she's not actually as enjoyable to watch. Margot Kidder played the role perfectly…she was always feisty as hell and hard as a nail when it came to dealing with people, but whenever she was around Superman she completely melted. The ""I spent the night with Superman"" scene from the 78 movie, referenced in this new one, is still the best scene from any Superman flick. Reeve and Kidder killed in that scene. But unfortunately Bosworth's Lois didn't resemble Kidder's at all and she didn't add much to the character in this film. I guess having the kid softened her up, but while that created some good ideas, it didn't make for a good Lois Lane.Spacey was great as Luthor, much less light hearted and witty than Gene Hackman was, but much more vicious, which was cool. I don't think Hackman's Lex would play well with today's audiences…as it was very cartoonish. Spacey did a good job.Overall I loved the movie…Superman flying around never looked as believable as it did in this film and the use of his powers were cool. The opening sequence is the best opening sequence I've seen since…well, Superman: The Movie…and for anyone who loves that movie the final shot of this film is killer.Also great is the retention of the Jesus Christ\Superman allegory from Donner's film, though while it was subtle enough in '78, this film smacks you in the face with it. But it's always been a cool idea so who cares?Superman has Returned!",0,1,MiyagiDo,"Jul 20, 2006",
10,why we still need superman,"At 26 years of age i went into the cinema not really expecting a great deal but confident i was going to see a good movie, how wrong was i.From the moment the opening credits rolled i was transfixed into an 8 year old, i had waited 19 years to see the re-birth of superman and i was not disappointed in the slightest.Brandon Routh had some pretty big shoes to fill and man does he fill them his portrayal of Clark is warm , funny and sincere and he brings an edge to Superman that we have never seen.Routh's Superman has Human emotions that we all feel pain, hurt, the fact that the woman he loves may have moved on and does not share the love that they once had, you actually feel for Routh's Superman and feel his hurt.This film has been accused of being more of a chick flick and i'll be honest i would share that sentiment but, i wouldn't have this film any other way as we have to appreciate after 5 years gone it was never going to be wine and roses for Superman and he could never just reappear as if nothing had ever happened and the focal point of this movie is the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane and this needed to be examined in the movie for Superman in a sense to be reborn in the movie and not lead us to believe in the 5 years he was gone his disappearance did not mean something to the woman he loved and woman who loved him back.Enough of that now , can i just say Kevin Spacey is Lex Luthor, Gene Hackman was good but Kevin Spacey rocks and you can tell he enjoyed his role and has taken Lex to a whole new Level, i can't say to much but when you view this movie you will see what i mean.I cannot fault any of the cast in this movie and Bryan Singer has stayed true to Donners vision of Superman that is updated for the audience of 2006 and in my opinion is simply the only man that could of carried off a revival of the superman franchise.In closing i would like to add that i was the last one to leave the cinema, my friends were pleading to go and i wouldn't go anywhere till i had heard the closing Superman theme so they waited outside.Last week a 26 year old man became an 8 year old boy and i realised something, the movie going world still needs superman because he makes us all feel better about the world.10/10",1,1,Darren-Hutton,"Jul 20, 2006",
6,Super Superman and Lame Lois....Much better title.....,"This past weekend I finally got a chance to go ""Superman Returns"" and with lots of expectations within, found myself applauding a lot of the performances, incredible CG, and a mostly talented cast. Brandon Routh was the perfect casting for the Man of Steel to carry on a the role. From his hometown boy smile to his ""I'm the Man"" attitude he pulled it off and did credit for his predecessors. A bit young for the role, but I think we all have to keep in mind the timeline of things. I'd actually read the book prior to seeing the screen version and naturally found that Bryan Singer had taken a lot of changes from print to screen, but that's okay. It's the name of the game.I'm not sure how or why they found Kate Bosworth, but of the whole movies disappointments, she lead the pack. Not because she's not Margot Kidder, but because her youth, inexperience and lack of screen presence were so obvious that it nearly pulled the movie down the tubes. She looked more like she was from Kansas than Clark Kent! Whether you're reading a comic or watching an early version, this woman was no Lois Lane. I mean, put Phyllis Coates, Noel Neill, Margot Kidder, Terry Hatcher, and finally Kate Bosworth next to each other and you'll find yourself singing ""One of these things is not like the others""! It's not that she's a terrible actor, just truly not suited for this role and it's hard to believe that this fact slipped by when casting this person. Animated, spunky, charismatic, full of energy, and intelligent came natural for all of the others Lois's, but Kate somehow managed to make the role seem like a bowl of oatmeal without any sugar, fruit or butter. Anyway, I just couldn't see her pulling it off and please keep in mind, I wanted so badly to find nothing but positives about anything about this movie and the hard work put into bringing it to us, but Kate……..ya gotta go in the sequel honey!Kevin Spacey is one of my all-time favorite actors and it really wasn't a stretch to see him portray Lex Luthor. The man has got skills! Lex is someone we love to hate in a big way and bringing Mr. Spacey into the project helped keep things afloat and interesting for us!Sam Huntington was another good pick because he made the belief that he really was the lovable shutterbug we've come to love over the decades. Great job Sam!Hmmm, Frank Langella is another of my favorite screen actors, but as Perry White? Talented as the man is, he was just a little watered down for the Perry White I remember in books and screen. I could be totally off base, but since I've been reading ""Superman"" for over 35 yrs, I found the man to be loud, direct, focused, rude and generally doesn't care about others opinions about anything he's got going for himself. Frank tried, but came across as more of a wolf in sheep clothing. Go figure! Over all, it was okay and I did enjoy it, but couldn't also help but feel let down a little and found myself hoping that the sequel will pick up the slack for all of us.",1,1,pwrkatz,"Jul 20, 2006",
3,154 minutes of my life I can never get back,"If I could meet Bryan Singer I would say one thing. ""I want the last 154 minutes of my life back"". Then I would beat him for 154 minutes, to make up for the tragic loss of my life during this turd of a film.You have a great cast. Watching Brandon Routh is like watching Reeves reincarnate!!(hence 3 out of 10 not 0) Spacey is perfect as the crazy Luther. Even Kate Bosworth is OK, wet but OK.You have some great action scenes and effects.But the script is so bad that predictable does not begin to describe it. The Story line is interesting but again, so clichéd and predictable that it is painful. All the parts were there for him, but he fails to knit them together.Singer is trying so hard to make this an intelligent film, that he forgets to make it entertaining. If I want intellectual I will watch Schindlers list. I wanted all out action and heroics. That is what Superman is all about, not this over scripted, badly written emotional crap.Sorry, I had such high hopes that I feel crushed with disappointment.

8,"The man of steel is back, and what a return it is!","I think the thing I liked the most about this film, is that you can't be indifferent to the characters and to (most of) the events taking place in the film. I think that what made me give this movie an 8, is because I was emotionally drawn into some of the scenes of the movie. It's not a classical action packed film like mission impossible 2. It is more of a drama than the classical Comic action movie (like x-men 1 or the fantastic 4). Who will like this movie? If you liked Spider man 2 and 1, you'll probably enjoy this one as well. if you liked the original Superman movies, you'll feel at home here. The plot it self is not so original and pretty simple. There are a lot of emotions between the two main characters of the film, and I actually felt great sympathy to the man of steel and all he goes through. I was worried, I was even a little moved by some of the final scenes. The musical score, partially based on the original John Williams Score is outstanding and serves the plot very well. The visuals are great as well. except for one or two shots where it is obvious that CG was used, everything looks very authentic. 400 millions the movie cost, and you can certainly see where it went. I really liked the shots of superman in outer space.Who will not like this film? Well, if you didn't enjoy Spider man2 you can leave this one behind. if you're not into comic super heroes type of films or you didn't like the original Superman films- you can leave it behind too. I think the reason I gave it an 8 and not a 9 or a 10 is because of lack of depth in the plot. But all in all - It is anything but easy to bring Superman to the screen after 14 years break. I think that Bryan singer did it respectfully.I liked the words of Jor Al, Superman's father (The voice of Marlan Brando), which is heard at the end of the teaser trailer (and in the movie) as well... an optimistic view on humanity and man kind...

9,"A fantastic, grown up super hero movie","This is a movie that, similar to Peter Jacksons efforts, concentrates on elements of story that we sort of already know, throws in a few intelligent twists, and lets the CGI complement the story. Obviously comparisons will be drawn with other super hero movies such as X-men, Spiderman, Fantastic 4, etc but those were movies aimed squarely at today's youth that like a good bit of hour and a half popcorn accompaniment. It wasn't until the 2nd or 3rd sequels that they really get into their character based stride. If you must make a comparison then this is more akin to the last Batman movie. The acting is absolutely as good as it needed to be for this type of film, with a brilliantly cast Kevin Spacey, and a brilliantly mis-cast Kate Bosworth, who just manages to be a bit Lois like near the end. Brandon Routh is a movie find in a million, bringing to the roll the elements that the comic book hero exuded from every atom. He's sculpted rather than born, beautiful and handsome mixed, super in every way. If the had to cast David then Routh is your boy. The plot is very comic book, and it won't win an Oscar for originality. However the underlying story about the loss of love, the pain of realising your heroes don't exist anymore, and then the rebirth of hope, rekindling of feelings, and acceptance of the now rather than past is where Singer, Dougherty, and Harris really make the biggest impression. In one heartstoppingly dramatic moment I have never heard s cinema so quiet, and I mean not even a breath. Two and a half hours flew past. The balance of action/front story/backstory is a little out. There are some great action scenes, and I'd have liked to see a couple more. The Lex Luthor story is a little underplayed, and almost second to the relationship drama (so take your girlfriend, she'll like that...). Overall though, there is a fantastic sense of wellbeing when the film ends. It's OK, he's back.

3,Superman 'Returns' from a five year absence to discover Lois has gone off with anther man...,"'Superman Returns Disastrously' would be a more apt title for this shambolic, self-indulgent, overly-serious, dark and forbidding nightmare-world Brian Singer seems compelled to create whenever he ventures into the world of Superhero-dom. What he hopes to achieve by making everything so god-damned serious, I simply don't know, though I'm sure he believes he's done a great job restoring the character to his original 'moody' roots... Either way, the result of this 'restoration' is a masterpiece (or should that be 'crassterpiece'?) of formal, modern, wooden cinema that's worthy of an place alongside his other notable contribution toward world boredom, X-Men 1.Sorry for the negativity but there are lots and lots of problems with this film and I'm sure the people who've stupidly given this film a high rating will come to hate it with time - just like they did when they brought themselves a copy of Star Wars III on DVD and realised finally that the whole prequel 'experiment' had been a shambles from the start...It's not that I'm against Superman - I loved the previous films and Christopher Reeve was a legend in the role... But Brandon Routh ain't no Christopher Reeve and never will be. The same applies for Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey and the rest of the 'clones' they've hired for the project (seemingly on looks alone, for certain cast-members). But this isn't the actors fault - it goes deeper than this. The real fault lies with the producers. They're the ones that chose Bryan Singer to direct; they're the ones that okeyed the boring, tiresome script, and they're the ones that didn't demand the necessary changes to the yawn-inducing two-and-a-half hour story that focuses more on the characters 'feelings' rather than giving us the healthy dose of action, adventure and invention we expect from a Superman film. It hurts me to say this but what this picture really needed was Jerry Brockheimer at the helm. At least then Superman could have spoke with actions... and not the tension-ridden 'facial expressions' Bryan Singer seems to obsessed with.I can just picture the scene on set...Bryan Singer: ""OK Brandon, give me 'heartbreak'! Brandon Routh: (gurns his face) ""Grrr!"" Bryan Singer: ""More! That's good! Now throw in a bit of tension... Great! Now furrow your brow like this... OK, more!"" Brandon Routh: ""I'm furrowing as much as I can!"" Bryan Singer: ""Bulls**t! - There can never be 'too much' furrowing!

,It's a comic...and more,"Superman Returns...from his home planet, Krypton, the destruction of which years earlier sent Superbaby to Earth. (How the now-grown Superman visits a destroyed planet in the first place is another story.) During the course of the movie, Superman ascends to and hangs in outer space to survey which crisis to resolve and which people on Earth to save next, proving that he can either breathe in outer space (hey, if George Lucas can stage space battles with sound effects where no atmosphere exists...) or else hold his breath for a very long time. Yes, it's a comic, Folks. Case closed.But beyond the comics, despite a slow, lingering start (one can but imagine what scenes may be ""edited for time"" to fit into a two-hour TV time slot) the movie eventually revs up to blood-hot excitement with Superman's first save of the day. (Some reviewers have wondered how nobody in the movie noticed that Superman and Clark Kent returned at the same time after a five year absence. My wonderment is how Lois Lane managed to avoid certain-death situations during that same time period.) The one problem I had with this movie, although every actor turned in a fine performance, was that it was hard for me to get excited about, or involved with the characters in, any scene that didn't include Superman. Also of note, but not a problem, per se, is that I often found myself wondering, ""What's going on here?""...but director Bryan Singer managed to resolve most, if not all, such questions eventually.Having watched George Reeves' Superman on TV as a child, I was looking forward to seeing the actors who played Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen (Noel Neill and Jack Larson, respectively) from that series in this movie. I love it when I see actors older than I, like these (along with Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent) still alive and kicking...and performing! I just wish they could have found a part that would have made Ms. Niell more ""recognizable."" (Saying more might give something away.) As for the principal actors, I found the new Superman, Brandon Routh, to be quite acceptable, although I thought some of his lines could have been delivered with a bit more nuance. And of the half dozen or so actresses I've seen portray Lois Lane, I found Kate Bosworth as competent and captivating as any of them. Veteran Kevin Spacey makes an ideal Lex Luthor -- evil inside but deceptive in demeanor (except when riled) -- while Frank Langella as editor Perry White, and Parker Posey as bad-girl-with-a-soft-heart Kitty Kowalski are equally well-cast. (I saw James Karen in the credits but not in the movie. Perhaps they're saving his scenes for the DVD.) In the end, director Singer effectively combines action and romance to make this comic into a thoroughly human movie. The scenes between Lois and Superman are particularly touching.(One has to pity poor James Marsden as Perry White's nephew, Richard, and Lois' live-in partner. In vying for the heart of The Daily Planet's star reporter, Superman doesn't play fair merely by being himself.) I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel!",1,1,HallmarkMovieBuff,"Jul 21, 2006",
7,"Wonderful, heartfelt and exciting movie","Mr. Singer you have done us proud.I'll keep my comments on the film itself brief- straight forward story, great casting, great score (winning idea to retain Williams' themes, but Ottman added some great moments of his own), great pacing, beautifully, romantically and iconically shot and it left me with a great feeling at the end. Countless spine-tingly moments. By far the best critically reviewed blockbuster of the Summer and for once I agree with the critics.Now down to the nitty gritty- The reason for its box office slump? An extremely poor marketing campaign and general cynicism. I haven't met one person who didn't love this movie having seen it, but unfortunately I have met many more who didn't even know a new Superman film was coming out. THAT IS RIDICULOUS- the biggest and most well known superhero of them all and nobody knows about the characters' major new motion picture? Why do they not know? Poor marketing, as I've said.Warner, you have a lot of explaining to do- you may well have single-handedly destroyed your strongest franchise. For months my brother and I have been wondering ""Where is the big push?"" We could see Pirates and X-3 posters and trailers everywhere since last year, awareness was way up and everybody went to see them. The trailers were available for Superman, but they weren't being screened, the posters and standee's only went up weeks before release in cinemas, billboard posters in my home town were non-existent and as a result, awareness was way down. Even fans of Smallville I spoke to, weren't aware that a new Superman movie was coming out!!! Warner have done this twice now- once with Batman Begins and now with Superman Returns- easily 2 of the best superhero movies around and neither one did the box office that was expected. Why?!!! Poor marketing. I wonder if the Matrix debacle has something to do with this. Heavily hyped and subsequently, Reloaded did well because EVERYBODY and his dog went to see it once, but not many people liked it- the 3rd movie therefore failed. Maybe because of this, Warner are afraid to pump money into marketing big movies in a big way in case poor word of mouth brings the film to its knees- They needn't have worried with Batman and Superman- both are great movies.Warner, pull your socks up and give Bryan Singer the chance to make another Superman movie and this time, market the sh*t out of it. It's either your arrogance or fear which has lead to this movie not bringing in the expected receipts and neither Singer nor the film is to blame.

Well, I think this is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time and to be honest, you have to watch it on the big screen. The special effects, the acting, the story are all excellent. The Direction is seamless and the CGI's are cleverly done. I'm not going to describe what's in the film, but the overall sensation of watching it is an uplifting one - you want to believe a man can fly and most certainly with the special effects in this film, you take it for granted that he can.Brandon Routh is an excellent Superman, very reminiscent of Christopher Reeve, Kevin Spacey plays a genuinely unnerving Lex Luthor and Kate Bosworth gives a touching performance as Lois Lane. From the moment the film starts with a very definite nod to Donner's original and the rousing John Williams score, you know you're in for a good time. And boy do you get it! Simply put - go see this film. It's not perfect, it's not the best film of the last decade or any of that nonsense, it's just pure entertainment from start to finish.

10,Superman has returned!!!,"It's been over 19 years since Superman last graced our screens. The All American Icon, portrayed by the memorable and unfortunate late Christopher Reeve, won over audiences in the 70's and 80's with his action, effects, characters and plots. The WB has spent years, and nearly 260mil dollars trying to bring the most loved Superhero back to our screen, and with Bryan Singer leaving X-Men- it seems they have. Filmed right here in Australia, no movie is more anticipated this year, then the year that Superman Returns.Following a mysterious absence of several years, the Man of Steel comes back to Earth in the epic Superman Returns. While an old enemy plots to render him powerless once and for all, Superman faces the heartbreaking realization that the woman he loves, Lois Lane, has moved on with her life. Or has she? Superman's bittersweet return challenges him to bridge the distance between them while finding a place in a society that has learned to survive without him. In an attempt to protect the world he loves from cataclysmic destruction, Superman embarks on an epic journey of redemption that takes him from the depths of the ocean to the far reaches of outer space.While no one can replace Christopher Reeve, when Brandon Routh turns around as Clark Kent and Superman, you could swear it was 1978. Kate Bosworth is a little aggressive and not as quirky as Lois Lane, but she makes up for it in making Lois more then a victim. The highlight performance for me though was Kevin Spacey- who shows no compassion, reason or sense as the ultimate villain. He masters the role.While no movie can rely on special effects, Superman Returns certainly has plenty of it. From the most amazing plane sequence in cinema history, to the saving of Metropolis with his powers- the effects show us the action and keep it as real as possible. Another amazing feature of production is that Superman Returns was shot entirely digitally, with no film. It gives the film as pastel look, that's suits well with a 21st century Superman.The film also dives into a couple of themes like father/son relationships between alien and human. Some of the stuff is deep, not what you'd expect from a Superman film. Also, crowd reactions to disaster of a sense of doom. This is a post 9/11 Superman.Although it took over 19 years for Superman to Return- he has. He has flown in and won over the hearts of fans and casual movie goers alike. While at times suffering from some slow scenes, Superman Returns maintains the grace and standard of Richard Donners 1978 film. Go and witness the rebirth of a global icon. Witness Superman's return. 9/10",1,2,tjo-El,"Jul 21, 2006",
3,"Not Very Super, Man.","Although Brandon Routh is beautiful, Chris Reeve had more charisma from his wheelchair. I just watched S1 again and the comparison is unfortunate for the 'new' superman. Not to mention all of the lines and situations that were flat out stolen from the original movie. Keven Spacey, however, is brilliant and Parker Posey is quite amusing, particularly when compared to Kate Bosworth's mushy Lois Lane. What about Mr. Spacey and Ms. Posey as Superman and Lois and leave the other two out of the next movie? Yeah, the FX are cool, but the movie drags badly, with pacing sacrificed to FX. They tried to make up for a bland Superman and Lois with the FX - I was bored after 30 minutes with 2.5 hours to go...",2,2,chantaladams,"Jul 21, 2006",
6,With the planet on his shoulders…Daily,"Superman Returns. The name says it all. Our Man of Steel returns to our collective consciousness after almost 20 years. Has he arrived with the big bang all the hype has culled together? Unfortunately, not even close. Bryan Singer leaves his flourishing X-Men saga to helm an obligatory bridge episode in an already watered down series. While Chris Nolan had a ton of success with his reinvention of the Batman chronicles, Singer is hindered by the fact that this is a continuation two decades later. The heart and emotion is there, the acting is there, the story could have been rewritten with slight changes—all for a rebirth of the legendary hero. Instead, we as an audience go into the movie knowing its place in history, occurring after the first two installments as movies three and four have been all but erased from the echelon of cinema. Too many callbacks to the original, too much unwarranted camp in an otherwise serious drama, too muddled of a story where we as an audience are reminded by characters about a plot point before we are whisked off to continue that story thread. There is some intelligence in the movie going public, we know the story of Superman and didn't need a handholding session in a sequel, which they decided for this to be.Maybe it's the fact that we have been given the brilliantly handled television drama Smallville, which delves into Clark Kent's psyche and opens our eyes to the real trouble his dual life creates. It seems the filmmakers also have this in the back of their heads—besides the fact that even though we have moved Metropolis back to the east coast, a train set still contains the obscure town sign of Smallville, Kansas—as they seem to want to take a serious tone, although they won't quite take it the distance. Sprinkled in we have Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor, with great shades of sinisterness, trying too hard to do his best Gene Hackman impression. The camp just didn't fit the character we are introduced to, a man much eviler than Hackman's incarnation who would con an old millionaire woman on her deathbed to signing over her estate while the family waited outside. The indecision to pick a consistent tone with Lex made it hard to really see him as someone capable of mass-genocide; we desperately needed Ned Beatty's bumbling Otis to play him off of, instead of the stoic, hardened criminals he accompanies. Also, Parker Posey is an annoying, thrice-removed Xerox copy of the old Mrs. Teschmacher; and did Kal Penn get paid for this movie or did he remove himself from the film and they decided not to redub his lines with another actor as they did for Gene Hackman in Superman 2—I don't think he spoke one word in the entire movie.The film was not without its merits, however. Brandon Routh does an amazing job filling the large shoes left by the late Christopher Reeves. He isn't given much of an opportunity to run with the Clark persona, hopefully subsequent films will bring out more of this, but his portrayal of the conflicted Kal-El is well played. Props also go to Kate Bosworth with a nice turn as Lois Lane. Having really only seen her in the likes of Blue Crush, with exception to a good performance in Wonderland, I was pleasantly surprised to see her pull off playing a character beyond her years, (a 23 year old actress playing a Pulitzer Prize winning star reporter for the biggest paper in the country's biggest city), a stretch for most as seen with Katie Holmes' dismal portrayal of an Assistant DA in Batman Begins. The twenty-first century also helped usher in some gorgeous special effects, with detailed set pieces and action scenes, (the airplane/shuttle rescue was well executed visually). Instances of see-through vision also sparked my attention, most evident in Clark following Lois through the Daily Planet doors, up the elevator to the roof.Singer seemed to have had all the elements there for a successful restart in a dead series. He should have created a new world as he did with X-Men's tie to reality instead of trying to build upon a 20-year old movie. Callbacks in movies of this kind are good fodder for laughs to the fans of a series. Short quips like Jimmy Olsen's initial ""Mr. Clark! Kent…I mean Clark Kent"" and Clark's ""swell"" remind you of scenes from the original and bring a small to your face. However, having a moment like this every 10 minutes gets old and very unoriginal, from Lex's speech about his father's advice to gather land, Superman's ""flying is still the safest way to travel"", and his ""Lois you really shouldn't smoke"", we are beaten over the head with these allusions to past greatness. (And on the smoking front, is our society so without faith in our parenting skills on teaching kids not to smoke that we have to put smoking as a rating point. It's as if our favorite chain-smoker Lois Lane would have died instantly, or at the very least caused an R-rating had she actually lit that cigarette; it's a part of her character. Being weak and taking that out was a public service announcement that took me out of the film a bit, especially when it is then OK to show Lex puffing on his cigar.) I won't even mention the unnecessary plot-device of Lois's child or the few discrepancies to the previous two films we are to believe this follows, or the multiple Jesus allusions—well I guess I just did. The makings of a great installment were there, but expectations were not fulfilled. Hopefully the Return has happened and now Singer and company can sink their teeth into a real Superhero masterpiece. The dream is still alive.",0,0,jaredmobarak,"Jul 21, 2006",

7,"I wasn't expecting much, so it wasn't too bad","Movies are terrible anymore, but I still occasionally like to go to theaters (especially when the weather is forecast at 96 degrees) so I have been reduced to seeing movies like ""Superman,"" even though I don't like action films, or read comic books, and two hour and 49 minute running times are not exactly a turn on, either...In spite of that, this wasn't the worst movie ever made. Like about 90% of the movie going public, I had never heard of Brandon Routh, and since he's a young ""pretty boy,"" I was expecting him to be pretty awful, so while I don't exactly expect him to clean up at that Academy Awards (as if that's really a measure of talent anymore, anyway) he wasn't that bad. Kevin Spacey, as evil Lex Luthor, was a little happy and over-the-top, but was kind of written as such and I enjoyed the 'team' of Parker Posey and him. (I think the film could have saved a couple of million dollars in the budget by eliminating Luthor's other friends, however (except perhaps that man with the skeleton tattoo) as they mostly just stood around and scowled.) As for Kate Bosworth... I didn't exactly find her endearing, though a little of that may have been the character of Lois Lane. This wasn't exactly my first exposure to ""Superman,"" but it came close enough, and, well... I can only hope Lois Lane was more likable in the older versions. I couldn't imagine why one man would find her appealing, let alone two...As I cannot judge a movie on acting and characters alone, this one was fair. Movies like ""Superman"" are never made for their wonderful scripts and this one... wasn't the best, my biggest complaint being lack of development. While I will credit ""Superman"" above such films as ""War of the Worlds"" with having at least SOME development and continuity, there were definitely a lot of things that went unanswered. I didn't especially care for all of the past tense referrals in the beginning, which, combined with the somewhat strange title of what is assumingly part one of a series made me feel like I was actually seeing a sequel first. I also would have liked to have seen more Clark Kent, who I felt was hideously underdeveloped. I would have gladly traded the numerous scenes of rocks flying through the sky (what was with that?) for more scenes of Clark and ""Earth"" mother(especially an explanation of his first scene where he came falling into the farmhouse yard appearing on the verge of death... and was completely fine and suddenly in ""Metropolis"" in the next scene.) I wouldn't have minded learning more about the Lex Luthor character, who vaguely moved about with no rhyme or reason. While I was entertained enough by Lex Luthor, and I don't exactly mind 'not' being scared by a villain, the character was almost a little bit too silly and not exactly a role Kevin Spacey is going to get taken seriously for.I don't think ""Superman Returns"" will ever be taken seriously by anybody and it doesn't exactly have the makings of a film that will even be much remembered in years to come. With it's (needlessly) long running time, I honestly don't even know if I'll be watching it again (at least not in its entirety), but it was likely better than most of the other junk that's out these days and was a perfectly inoffensive way to spend a 90+ degree afternoon.",1,2,Goon-2,"Jul 22, 2006",

,The world does need Superman!,"Like many other people, the character of Superman has always been a firm favourite of mine dating back to my childhood. Christopher Reeve's Superman made me believe a man could fly with the light-hearted 'Lois and Clark' series seeing me through the Nineties. I was sceptical as the next Supes fan when I heard they were to bring back the character, recast and revitalised for a twenty-first century audience. But having seen 'Superman Returns', those fears were instantly pushed back as I now eagerly await a sequel.'Superman Returns' is set five years after Christopher Reeve's 'Superman II' (thankfully ignoring the events in the lacklustre 'Superman III and IV'). Superman, after five years of searching for the remains of his homeplanet Krypton, has returned to Earth to resume his life as Clark Kent only to find things moved on without him. Lois Lane is now mother to five-year-old son Jason and engaged to Perry White's nephew Richard. She is also thoroughly disenchanted with Superman although it soon becomes clear there is much unresolved feelings between the two. But between juggling his conflicting emotions for Lois and his duties to protecting the population, Superman has to face his arch-enemy Lex Luthor, who has stolen the crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and is intent on using them to rule the world.It was never going to be easy Brandon Routh to step into Christopher Reeve's shoes but he takes it in his stride, managing to capture the bumbling but kindly nature of Clark and the strong, reserved demeanour of a Superman who strives to find a balance between his alien heritage and the life he has made for himself on Earth. He both makes the role his own yet does well in succeeding where Reeve left off. Kate Bosworth was also another surprise. I was very disappointed in her casting initially but seeing her perform in the film left me realising that she was perfect for the job as she portrays the cocky and determined yet vulnerable Lois to a tee. Kevin Spacey was great as the obsessive, slightly unhinged Luthor who possesses a real hatred for our hero while Parker Posey gave us a nicely-portrayed 'shades of grey' character in Kitty, a villain with a heart. Even the little moppet who played Jason gave a decent performance without being wooden or grating.What I loved most about the film is that it delivered an interesting storyline that didn't reject the first two 'Superman' films, which are classics in the heart of any Superman fan and had already done a good job in covering the origins story. But at the same time, it didn't shirk in giving us deeper insights into the character of Superman, the solitary hero and the man who just wants to fit in. What was a pleasant surprise was that the film also refused to dumb down to small children in the audience, which is a growing problem with many Hollywood films that over-dose on infantile humour to appeal to kids resulting in boredom for anyone over fourteen. There was humour, some on a level to make children laugh, but overall there was a nice mix of action, romance and darkness aimed more at an older audience. They even avoid the clichéd pitfall of portraying Lois' love interest to be a sanctimonious twit and instead he came across as a genuinely nice guy who shows that it's understandable why she has problems choosing between him and SupermanIn fact, my only real problem was that there wasn't enough interaction between Lois and Clark, which would have been nice as Clark's jealousy towards his alter-ego and the attention Lois lavishes on him is a large part of the story yet in the film, you felt as if Clark and Superman really were two different people with Clark just being some rather random guy. However, it can be over-looked by the fact that Clark was so happy to just have Lois' attention that he didn't care whether it was projected onto himself in his real personality or on Superman.For anyone who has yet to see the film, I do recommend it and don't allow yourself to be put off by nitpickers complaining about the actors' being too young (better they be a shade on the younger side than going the 'Smallville' route where you have adults in their late twenties and thirties prancing around pretending to be teens and just looking ridiculous for it) or that the film is too long (even the eight-year-olds in the audience sat quietly, glued to the screen, for the entire film) or that it's bland (no more so than 'Spiderman'). I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to a sequel. After a rather dull summer at the cinema, this film renewed my faith in the summer blockbuster!",223,152,cosmic_quest,"Jul 22, 2006",

The 1978 film, hardly a classic itself, at least had a sense of fun and did not take itself too seriously. Singer attempts a darker mood but ends up sucking all the joy out of it. The action scenes are too drawn out, loud, confusing, and laden with special effects. The best parts of the movie are the scenes between Clark and Lois but there are few such scenes and they are not mined for all their comic potential.

I enjoyed seeing the film because it has been a long time since the last Superman movie, but not because I thought it was a good movie. I just enjoyed seeing Superman again. The movie sets up a sequel better than it tells a story, it is unfortunate and unnecessary. I guess the writers felt they had loose ends to mend, attempting to revive the storyline, they created more of a cliff notes movie sequel to the Christopher Reeves movies rather than a movie that could stand on it's own. Movie making technology has improved so much that on that basis alone fans should see the film, but it pales in comparison to the Spiderman movies. Why do the writers feel compelled to carry forward the same storyline as the Christopher Reeves movies? Everyone knows it's a completely new cast of actors playing the roles, so why not start fresh with a new storyline? It's disappointing.

3,Faster then a speeding locomotive?  Try slower than molasses.,"Superman Returns is a groan-inducing film. You'll want to boo at the screen as you're exiting the movie theater. The main problem is how it was edited. The final cut is two hours and fifty four minutes long and simply doesn't need to be. Just for example: There a far too many pregnant pauses between lines of dialog; There are ten second character reaction shots when a one second shot would have sufficed; Characters take thirty seconds to walk across a room and open a door when the action could be edited down to two seconds. It's a shame, really. Tighter editing might easily have trimmed 20 to 30 needless minutes, and faster pacing would have helped to camouflage the film's various other shortcomings. Chief among them: Kate Bosworth's terrible acting, clunky dialog, and an often murky plot.To be fair, Superman Returns does have a few things going for it. First off, Brandon Routh. In person, the actor seems to lack charisma or sex appeal. Even on screen, in his Clark Kent persona, he fails to make much of an impression. But about forty minutes into the movie, when he first dons those blue tights and red cape, you at last understand why Routh was cast. He actually looks like a superhero. What Routh has -- its not sex appeal exactly -- its a sort of idealized, masculine beauty. It's probably the most memorable thing about the film.The film also has at least one exciting, well-choreographed CGI action sequence involving a jumbo jet in a fiery tailspin. Brief, close-up jump cuts back and forth between Superman flying outside the plane and the passengers tumbling around inside the plane's cabin help to build suspense. No doubt this CGI sequence was storyboarded down to the last frame. Perhaps that limited the film editors' influence over this scene's pacing. Regardless, it was exciting and fast-paced-- standing out in an otherwise maddeningly slow film.The film also gets a boost from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Compared to Gene Hackman's hammy take on the character in the original Superman movie, Spacey's performance here is understated, subtle, and downright sinister. You really believe this Luthor can and will kill Superman. Unfortunately, Spacey isn't given enough screen time. (He has only one scene with Superman and it is arguably the best scene in the movie.)",0,2,dennisayers,"Jul 22, 2006",

I thought the story was pretty good and made sense. But, I will agree it's silly that Lex Luther got out of a life sentence because Superman didn't show up at court when his parole hearing came up in less than 5 years.The one part that I thought was a big mistake was Superman flying an island of crystal/kryptonite into outer space. I thought being near kryptonite weakened him till he can barely stand. But, his hands are within inches of kryptonite as he lifts it up. Still don't get that stunt.But, I really liked it showing Superman flying into fire and stopping bullets with an eye.

If I am enjoying the entertainment of a film in a cinema and need to go to the loo I usually just leave the cinema without a moments hesitation but with Superman Returns, even missing one second of it was one second too much.

6,If you like two hours of special effects....,"Although most of the reviews for Superman Returns have been good or even excellent, I must disagree. The storyline is - to be blunt - ridiculous, and, although Brandon Routh looks almost exactly like Christopher Reeve (Who played Clarke Kent in the original shows), this is the only similarity that the two shows share. I thought that both Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey did exceedingly well, considering the material they had to work with. What amazes me is that when there are no constraints for the storyline (Superman can do anything) Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris (Screenplay) still manage to complicate the plot in such a way that it is very confusing at some points during the film. Another major flaw in this film is that the hero does not have a fault. In Spiderman, Peter Parker is always trying to juggle his life as a superhero with his life as a normal human, and this usually leads to some problem that he needs to overcome. However, in Superman Returns, no one seems to bat an eyelid when Clarke Kent disappears at exactly the same time as Superman, and so it is easy for Kent to lead a normal social life. As for any suspense in the film, Superman can fly, take an unlimited number of bullets to the torso and not be remotely injured, and is able to extinguish fire with his eyes- so where is the challenge in that? In conclusion this film, massively over-budgeted was not exciting, the simple plot did not work and was at some points extremely confusing. On the plus side however, the special effects (70% of the film) were amazing... but after an hour or so they do get a little repetitive, or maybe thats just me.",0,1,olly-see,"Jul 23, 2006",
8,"True to its roots, but modern to boot","Superman Returns is an excellent film, not least because of director Bryn Singer's respect for the original four films (1978-1989) but because they are now wrapped so tightly in CGI and bullet-time as to be thoroughly modern. Sometimes the story is a little predictable, but even so it is done with such style as to be instantly forgiven. All the characters are strong, but there wasn't enough Clark Kent. I've always loved Kent for his stumbling, bumbling ways; the real antithesis of Superman. There are also a couple of nods to the film's DC Comics roots - referring to Gotham city in a news report for example - which adds interest for the knowledgeable viewer. I think this film will be a very personal thing for those who see it, either liking it, hating it, being ambivalent about it - so see it you should.",5,3,Sukieholland,"Jul 23, 2006",
2,Another one bites the dust...,"The are good and bad comic book movies. There are bad ones with some eye candy, and bad ones without any. This one is the former. Frankly I expected a lot more from this movie.The late 70s, early 80s Superman flicks with Reeve were something I enjoyed watching as a kid, but now as I look back at those I find them pretty cheesy. ""Superman Returns"" seems a continuation of the last 4 movies, only a bit less cheesy (just a little bit).There is nothing exciting about this movie, there are only a few nice CGI sequences and general acting is pretty much average at most.My final opinion:",0,2,chi-26,"Jul 23, 2006",
8,Memorial to Christopher Reeve,"Brian Singer is reported on this site as being unwilling to do this movie if he couldn't use John Williams' score. I think this is the key to understanding the tone and motivation of this 'sequel' to Superman 2. The leisurely way in which the characters are introduced, the scenes beautifully lit and detailed with references to the earlier Salkind productions reveal Singer's reverence and affection. If you went to see the first Superman movie at an impressionable age (as I did) it is difficult to be objective as you sit with a little reminiscent smile on your face. However, it is too long and the co-stars are not sufficiently exploited, leaving it a little short on humour. HOWEVER, Brandon Routh's performance lingered in the memory after I had left the cinema - not given much to say, he is a powerful and haunting presence, the sense of his loneliness and central goodness is persuasive and only surprising if you forget that he had clearly modelled his performance on the late Christopher Reeve. Once you recollect this blighted man's freshness and sincerity in the role do you forgive the missed opportunities of this feature and look forward to the sequel. Brian Singer has proved himself a safe pair of hands.",10,3,square-peg,"Jul 23, 2006",
8,What an achievement!,"I do think I need to say too much about this film. I think a lot of people will see it for themselves, and if you're any kind or Superman/comic book hero/action/adventure fan go out tonight and enjoy. I cannot begin to imagine how hard it was for the writers/director/actors to make this. Unlike Batman Begins (also excellent), they didn't just have to deal with the legacy of the character, they had to deal with the loyal following and tragic demise of Christopher Reeve who owned Superman on film for so many. Simply put, they couldn't have done better. It's a credit to everyone, respectful to Reeve's legacy with a massive nod to his mannerisms for Kent, his look, everything. Routh is a joy to watch, his face is perfect, flawless as you imagine Superman's would, and the mixture of strength and vulnerability he brings is spot on. It's all about him and you could watch him as Superman or Kent for the full 2 hours alone! Spacey is a hoot as Lex, he always has this undercurrent of manic evil under the giddy gentleman exterior. I have no complaint with Bosworth either, having heard she was awful - she is fine.

4,i couldn't quite put my finger on it.....,"I am not sure what direction this movie was supposed to go, but for over 2 hours; I personally feel the film maker should have something to show, i.e. a story, in depth, perhaps with a few twists. This was pretty predictable, and I don't merely mean the story, even the comedic quips and one liners the characters used would be mouthed by young teenagers watching the film for the first time.The plot wasn't even two-dimensional; and the one dimension it possessed was time. I left the theatre thinking the most visually impressive item in the movie was the yacht (not when it split in 2 before that after all, anyone see Titanic?), even the crystal retreat lacked any kind of visual allure.Possibly more Underwhelming than Batman Forever. This is a shame, I liked Kevin Spacey as Lex, his rapport with Kitty was excellent. I wasn't even disappointed by Brandon Routh. The actors were great. Direction, Editing and distinct lack of special effects made this film less than mediocre.

How long was that anyway? was it as long as Lord of the Rings which needed not intermission? or Troy, ditto. No it wasn't, the intermission is because you need to go get coffee and come back. They are a lot of villains in the comics that fight ""superpunk"", no this is just a recent resentment brought forth from immense disappointment endured in the form of the ""greatest super hero"". But I digress. There are adequate villains to search from to make the story more interesting. Like Doomsday for instance who ended up killing Superman, not winning the fight but... Then there is Darkstorm. Give the story something for the superman fans to work with. Why would we have to watch this pathetic portrayal of the ""man of steel"", in fact he looked more like the ""man of foil"". He is not my favorite hero but he is pretty OK. I mean he is not Spider Man, who beat him by the way, but that is beside the point. For the time we spent we deserve to be entertained not what ever that was that happened. Give us the time back.

8,That blue kind of magic,"To begin with a disclaimer : I don't usually like Superman. Yes, like most teens of my generation I fell for muscular Dean Cain and bubbly Teri Hatcher's cute antics in Lois & Clark, but the man in tights never truly blew my mind.this may have to do with 1) my love of geeks (I'd pick Clark anytime) 2) the fact that I'm not American , when, let's face it, you just can't get more American that Superman (sorry, there is a guy with a cape / no cape named Captain America somewhere ?)I also don't have a comics' education, my contact with superheroes is through films only and I just went to see that one because I was is a state of shock after United 93 and just couldn't stand on my feet anymore.All this being said : Superman returns is an amazing film! Not only is it a great superhero film but it is also a wonderful piece of popular entertainment, every bit as wonderful as X Men 2 (Singer's previous venture into the field).Superman returns is an action film because there are plenty of special effects, a bunch of heavy things that get lifted and thrown into space and some regular old style thrashing going on. But he who comes here looking for cheap thrills will go back frustrated because what SR is first and foremost is a very melancholy musing on love and loss, and alienation.This is a guy's film that I found fully and unabashedly directed towards women. It is extremely romantic in it's treatment of Lois and Kal El's relationship, but what makes it oh so precious is the poetry that pervades most of its shots and gives it its distinct tone.The film and Brandon Routh's excellent performance communicates a sense of sensual yearning, yet a composed, almost distant yearning, the one that Kal El feels for his planet but also the one he feels for Lois. All too human feelings felt by a ""man"" whose mission is so inhumanely to be a role model and show us the light like his father appointed him to.This crafty psychological construction of Superman made me find him the most fascinating character in the film and for the first time he took poor little Clark's place in my heart.For me to write this, there must really be some magic at work here and ... yes, ... Routh's to die for features are not totally foreign to that effect, but Singer's pure talent is to praise even for that !",5,2,Georgelie_Hewingson,"Jul 23, 2006",

Superman Returns is more of what I was looking for. First of all, the actors could actually act. Kate Bosworth is the first Lois Lane I've liked since I was small. Margot Kidder's Lois Lane was written with very little charm. Mr. Routh was quite good. He seemed to have been born to play the role. Kevin Spacey was the Lex Luthor of my comic book years. I loved his cold-blooded portrayal. The dialog was something worth listening to and was delivered well. Not too much info . . . just enough. Some parts of the film, the more intimate ones, reminded me of theater. I'm glad they kept the theme music from the Reeve film. It sounded even better here.

In his absence, Lois Lane has become a mother, while archenemy Lex Luthor is planning his next criminal empire. The latest chapter in the Superman saga makes an impressive splash! Brandon Routh is well cast as Superman, proving himself a worthy successor to the late Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey makes a fine Lex Luthor as well.

There was no sense of excitement, the feeling that you were shouting for Superman and shouting against Lex Luthor like the original films. The fact that Brandon Routh more or less did an impersonation of Christopher Reeve didn't feel right. Too big on slow moments and not enough action.

10,Superman Returns...................in style!!,"Let me cast your mind back to a time where Superman was the top dog, he was the super hero of super heroes. From batman we had a poxy (yet somehow entertaining) series, from spider-man we had a cheap o' nasty series and some cartoons but from superman we had full-length feature films starring Christopher Reeve who for several generations will always be Superman. Now all was going well, Superman was a hit and so was Superman 2 but then by the 3rd film things started (as they usually do) to take a dive. Superman 3 was out of ideas, some pretty lame baddies and a bit more of a comedy than a proper Superman film, then Superman 4 : the quest for peace. Frankly the title says it all, Superman has to fight Nuclear man, a really poor enemy for the man of steel, it was a complete flop and Superman's 15 minutes of fame was over. So we enter the late 80's/early 90's Batman is the superhero to be but then he suffers the same fate after 2 good films comes a poor 3rd and an awful 4th, but as we get to the new millennium a new superhero emerges as the best. Spiderman comes out at the pictures and is amazing followed by an even better Spiderman 2, but Batman makes a come back with the best film of the lot, so with these to superhero heavyweights battling it out where is the daddy of superheroes?? Well he doesn't take it lying down and comes back with Superman returns, and return he does, after about 10 minutes of getting back to earth he's having a pint with Jimmy Olsen then he's saving a jumbo jet from crashing to earth, he puts on a show and a half not only does he have to stop a jumbo jet but after Lex Luthor (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey) hatches his latest evil plan he has to save the whole of Metropolis, now can Batman and Spiderman do that, I don't think so. Brandon Routh looking like the late great Christopher Reeve helps make this film seem like a sequel and with a performance like Spacey's it's got to be the best Superman yet.

Only Lex Luthor causing trouble as always! I have to admit that when i heard the title Superman Returns i was anticipating and expecting one of the most daring plot twists in the superman comics. The storyline in which superman fights an almost indestructible super villain and dies defeating him and returning as a weaker superman (superman who cannot fly). But instead it is about a superman who went to see the remains of krypton and returns to earth (boring!!!!!!) I missed tension and action and humor. And normally I don't even pay attention to the length of movies in a negative sense(normally when a good movie is long it takes time to tell a story which can improve the movie), but in this case the movie is too long and boring. There were some action scenes I liked,but like I said earlier this movies lacks action! Which in a superhero movie must be the main attraction! I dare even to say that superman 3 and superman 4:the quest for peace are more enjoyable than this one.

9,You will believe a man can fly... again !!,"I've already seen this movie twice and i can say it's getting better more you're watching it because you can see things you didn't noticed.First of all, Superman Returns is the more touching, poetic, and visually stunning film you have ever seen. The casting is Solid, Brandon Routh is SUPERMAN. Even if Christopher Reeve remains the best actor for the part, Brandon Routh was the good choice to play the role. The story romance works very well between Loïs and Clark/Superman, even better than between Peter Parker and Mary Jane in Spiderman. I mean it's more touching. The style of Bryan Singer deserves a magnificent realistic film, he succeeds to make us believe Superman exists for real during 2h35. The music is SUPERB !! And one of the best thing in Superman Returns is the fact that it doesn't look like any other Super hero movies. It is unique in his genre because Bryan Singer directed this movie with his heart and not with the box office in his mind, so there is no action scenes for no reasons, there is very interesting issues like solitude and devotion. The only thing a bit disappointing is the evil plan of Lex Luthor( very well performed by Kevin Spacey by the way( which is a bit hard to believe and too much similar to the first Superman.

1,Do not use Singer for the Superman Return sequel,"There will definitely be a superman sequel. It is just a matter of time. However, although Bryan Singer is a good director and producer, he should not direct the sequel. The job he did on Superman return was horrible and unacceptable for a movie of a budget of $200 million and a man of his talent. The plot sounds good at first hearing but a further examination will reveal it is of poor quality. Good directors like Speiberg never do this, thats something amateur do instead. I question some actor-casting decisions like that of Lois Lane and some characters like Jason White. The end of the movies bordered on stupidity in my opinion. I felt I did not get my money's worth out of the movie. I do give Singer credit on the graphics used in the movie and some story lines were good-ideas.

The second half picked things up a bit, but bordered on the ridiculous as far as the story is concerned. Kevin Spacey did a wonderful job playing a neurotic, delusional, and genius Lex Luthor. Also, at times it seems that Christopher Reeves is on the screen, great job Brandon Routh.

10,"A Spectacular, Thrilling, Funny, and Emotional Popcorn Flick","Bryan Singer has saved the day once again. This film under any other director, be it McG, Tim Burton, or Brett Ratner, would have flopped beyond belief. It took a long time to get a Superman sequel off the ground, but it was worth the wait. The casting, plot, and economical risks have all paid off. Superman Returns is up with Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 as one of the best superhero films ever.One of the things this film does best is use the classic '78 Superman and its sequel as a base for the film. The original John Williams music is still as triumphant and incredible as ever, and Marlon Brando's disembodied head and voice are used to great effect. But don't let that fool you: SR is anything but a remake. The creative minds behind the film did wonders in updating Metropolis as well as making the idea of why the world needs Superman relevant to today.Don't let his anonymity fool you: Brandon Routh was an absolutely perfect choice to play Superman. Not only does he have striking resemblance to the late great Christopher Reeve, but he does as good of a job owning the role that Reeve made. He's hilarious to watch as the awkward Clark Kent, and you can really see the pain and emotion that he carries with him as he returns from his home planet. His kind are all gone, Lois Lane has moved on, and he is once again given the burden to guide the people of earth. You couldn't have asked for a better choice Superman.The rest of the cast shines, too. Kate Bosworth (despite drawing the most criticism from everyone else) does great at being the fearless Lois Lane and shows amazing vulnerability when she realized that she may still love Superman. She lacks the big personality that Margot Kidder brought to the role, but that's a minor complaint. Kevin Spacey, Parker Posey, and the rest of the cast also play their parts to perfection and bring a lot of humor and heart to the film. Not to mention the little boy who played Jason, who I thought was a perfect choice.Despite Singer saying that SR was the closest thing to a chick flick he has ever done, don't let that fool you into thinking the film lacks the action. Seeing Superman rescue a plummeting airplane from the sky is classic, as is Superman deflecting a bullet off of his eyeball. You'll be pinned to your seat the whole time, you'll have no idea that the film is two and a half hours long. And the movie is a beauty to watch. The special effects are jaw-dropping throughout, and the atmosphere is done superbly. Watching Superman and Lois fly through the sky at night is hauntingly beautiful, as Superman tells her that everyday he hears people crying out for a savior.And that brings me to perhaps the most essential part of the movie: heart. Recent superhero outings like Fantastic 4 and X-Men: The ""Last"" Stand had none of it, playing out like Saturday morning specials with nothing but bombast and uninteresting characters. It's obvious that Bryan Singer but his heart and soul into this movie. The last half hour of SR is pure drama, and you feel the intensity for every second of it. Any other director would have ruined the movie by now, but Singer makes these characters living and breathing. It's near impossible not to get caught up in it.Though SR may not be the most successful movie of the summer, being out performed by mindless wastes of celluloid like ""X3"" and ""The DaVinci Code"", it stands out as one of the best. The film's scope, action, visuals, humor, and heart make it a must-see for any and all moviegoers. SR completely redeems the old Superman saga and hopefully promised a start for more Superman films to come.10/10",2,3,royale_w_cheez44,"Jul 24, 2006",
,No wonder this flew out of the theaters as fast as a speeding bullet.,"I'm going to rate this in comparison with the other 4 Superman films, though it only acknowledges the first two, and that's because it's less good than the first one, WAY less good than the second, and about on par with 3 and 4. I always liked 4 more than 3 because Chris Reeve wanted to make that one, and by gosh he deserved to. Anyway, it's a great beginning with the return of the wonderful Superman music (that is solidly based on the TV show music, if you couldn't tell) and the great titles, and a really well-done re-introduction to Superman and the rest of the characters. They're all performed in good style by the cast, sadly Lois is the weakest of the lot. Margot Kidder was the right blend of tough and feminine, and this new girl tries but is just short of that. Spacey makes me think that it's Hackman wearing a Spacey mask, he's that much on target. Routh is just a tad less of a Superman than Reeve was, but it's almost negligible. It's all very nicely done, and great action, but it's just TOO DARN LONG. The first half is fine, the second half drags it down. And I really think it would have been better to leave out the whole father is the son, etc, mumbo jumbo. It just seems silly. I also think it would have been better to let Lois be a single Mom, but then that would have given away the whole son of Superman thing right away.

I give it a couple stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the SpiderMan trailer that played before. Oh yeah, and there was some joker in the audience who had a flashlight that would shine the bat signal.

8,It's Got Potential,"I can't say the movie was disappointing, it was quite good for a Superman movie in 2006, but I felt something was lacking. Too much Superman and not enough Clark in my opinion. After all, Clark Kent is the real character, not Superman(just like Peter Parker/Spiderman). I thought Brandon Routh played an excellent Clark/Superman, best acting in the movie. Kate Bosworth wasn't that bad herself. She played Lois just like I imagined her to be. As for Spacey. For me he was disappointing. I think because he's to famous of an actor to play Lex Luthor. It was very hard for me to see Lex and not Kevin Spacey when I looked at him. Still, if I wouldn't have known him so well, I think I would have loved him.All in all, a good start for a new Superman series. I think there's definitely place for a sequel and I hope that future movies, if the case may be, will show more of Clarke and his relationship with everyone else, especially Lois, of course :)My rating: 8/10 (for it's potential)",2,2,dragos_popa17,"Jul 25, 2006",
1,Super Disappointing!,"Predicated on the ludicrous idea that Superman has finally deigned to return to the Earth he abandoned (in favor of a five year stint in space hoping to find some relics and survivors hurdling thru the void on the decades-old rubble of his home planet), Singer's Superman goes up, up and absolutely nowhere. No scratch that, it manages to go back in time to rehash the original Donner-helmed movies, which work as a fond fan-boy recollection, but not as the jumping off point of a modern or compelling story.In choosing to directly continue these events, Superman Returns negates much of its audience, those who are too young to recall them, and those who may not remember them with the studied reverence that Singer adopts in lieu of bringing anything new to the table. Returns rehashes the plots of these films to point of not bothering to develop the characters within the context of its own: how would a newcomer to the story know what motivates Lex Luthor beyond the fact that he is a criminal who Superman once apprehended? A disinteresting and needlessly convoluted love story is tacked on in the form of some banter back between Supes and the now single-but-betrothed-mother that is Lois Lane, all of which leads to a logical and obvious ""revelation"" about her child's paternity, that also doesn't read true to the Man of Steel.Singer has reinvisioned the Big Blue Boy Scout as an Emasculated Brain Dead Dolt, whose decisions, actions and powers are consistently deferred and undermined throughout the film. In what we can only assume was an attempt to make Superman more relevant to a modern audience by portraying him as more 'human', Singer's Superman spends so much of the film absent, restrained, infirmed or otherwise disabled, that one wonders what's so Super about him, and why we should even care anymore.

Not only did Brian Singer crap all over the X-Men franchise by skipping on the third installment, but he made this...I don't know, something. Personally, I detect the foul hand of producer John Peters in making this movie a total stinker. Both visually and thematically dark, and overhanging sense of depression pervades every cell of this film. Both derivative and slow, I really can't see anyone who is a fan of the first movies, Smallville, or even the comics enjoying this fracas. I mean, it seems like they decided to do Superman 1 with better effects.

8,Bryan Singer and his team are genius,"Sob Sob... It brings back so many darn memories. So Superman is here to stay and Brandon Routh's acting, mimicking so many of Christopher Reeves moves is genius. Bryan Singer could have easily made this film his own but instead showed a love for the older Superman movies except now he has digital effects which makes it really cool. I'm not sure how it would fare with comic fans. Superman appears constantly breaking up the drama with action. watching this film now will bring the older films into vogue for a while because there is so much of them in this film. Brandon reminded me so much of Reeves that I cried for the poor guy. I wish him well. Spaceys Lex Luther is darker more evil and the poorly dressed kitty is a good replacement for Miss Tessmocker. The music themes have been kept in tact from the original films as are credits and ending sequences. Daggy jokes and sequences have been replaced with a smooth story and a real tribute to Superman 2. There are some surprises and thrills. After seeing it I also can't wait to see what Brandon will do next. Can't wait for the next one.",3,2,juzzy_anderson,"Jul 26, 2006",

8,I wasn't a Superman fan,"Not a fan of the comics (though I read them, like everyone my age). Not a fan of the earlier movies with Christopher Reeve (though I watched them, like everyone back then).Bryan Singer manages to do something with this movie that the comics and earlier movies didn't - he made me sympathise with Superman. He showed me the loneliness, isolation and alienation that the last survivor of Krypton, living on Earth, must feel. A vulnerability that has nothing to do with kryptonite.Clark Kent's trademark clumsiness becomes a side effect of him trying to live in a more fragile human world, instead of a deliberate ""disguise"". Brandon Routh's Clark Kent is a much more sympathetic character than Reeve's.",0,0,jette-goldie,"Jul 26, 2006",

6,Not What i expected,"For years there has been no Superman, then they bring him back.... In my opinion i found this movie to be quite boring. Yeah the plane scene is good and maybe the....... wait no i think thats it. So many continuity errors, was furious. I want to know how superman can pick up a Krytonite Island...How? HOw? HOW?!! The mere sight or unseen presence of the stone makes him weak at the bloody knees but he can lift the island...? I HATE LOIS LANE, her character is appalling. she has a kid and puts them both in danger. What got me was how unrealistic the plane scene was with her. I mean if i was to get thrown around a plane which was being pulled out to space and there was no seat belt holding me down. i am pretty sure you would either pass out with a concussion, has serious internal bleeding or at least a bruise...But no the not so pretty Lois lane comes away unharmed. yet when when she bangs her head on a kitchen item she is out for the count. Movie is OK... Its like the first Spiderman, Boring with a few nice action sequences. Its gonna take the second movie to make a real impact. 1st Movies are always about setting the scene, making sure everyone begins on the same page.

10,Super Superman thanks to Singer and Routh,"Superman Returns is a fabulous telling of the essence of the Superman character as an alien god. Routh is superb both as an essentially lonely and sad Superman and as the (not so) bumbling Clark Kent. Give that man an Oscar right now. The action, set pieces, cinematography, and CGI are all breathtaking and seamlessly blended. Kudos to Singer. Marsden and Spacey are both excellent, but (in the film's only weakness) our new Lois Lane is just too self-absorbed to be entirely sympathetic as a character. Her vicious Pulitzer piece was unnecessary and spiteful, as if she ""knew"" that Superman's disappearance was all about her. Forget it lady. Men leave for lots of reasons, and you are not the center of the universe. Get over it. Apart from that, Singer's exploration of the lonely god amongst us is superb.",3,1,alexfirest,"Jul 26, 2006",
9,Superman has definitely returned with this one.,"There's a lot that could have been done wrong with Superman Returns. Bryan Singer was walking a thin line when he took over this project after a whole number of directors failed to make a good story with a character as complex as Superman. Some of the suggestions that the other directors had - * Retell the origin story of Superman. * Give Superman a futuristic look by completely changing his costume to black latex. * Make it an all out action movie complete with alien invasions and Metallo. * Make it an all out children's movie. (Fantastic 4)It's not an easy task making a movie in today's day and age about an overgrown boy-scout like Superman, but Bryan took a great personal perspective to the character and told a story that perfectly gels with everything that Superman stands for.Bryan has rightly shown that even with all the power in the world, Kal-El, the last son of Krypton is still alone in the universe. He is a lone survivor of a planet that does not exist. When he hears that astronomers have discovered remains of his home world, he left immediately without saying his goodbyes in hope of finding another like him. The loneliness of the character is subtly evident throughout the movie. This is something that most 'movie critics' missed out. Brandon Routh has perfectly handled the legacy passed on to him. The more you watch the movie, the more convinced you are that he was the perfect choice for the man of steel. With that said, Routh still needs to work on his Clark Kent skills. Instead of playing the meek, bumbling reporter, he played 'Superman with glasses'.Kate Bosworth was a pretty bad choice as Lois Lane. She definitely doesn't look like a person who'd go to any lengths for a saucy story or even as someone capable of wooing Superman. Kevin Spacey, however, takes Lex Luthor to a whole new level of evil. The evil genius of the character is far more evident this time than in all prior attempts. Even the goons he hires this time are dependable tough guys instead of inept, fat comedians.The action sequences completely deliver, with Superman saving people of Metropolis (and the world) in ways that could have never been shown in a movie before this. The sequences between Superman and Lois Lane are very well handled without making things too mushy. The addition of Lois Lane's kid to the movie may seem blasphemous at first, but it fits well with the story eventually. John Ottman's latest additions to the movies soundtrack are good but don't hold as strong as compared to the original theme by John Williams. Luckily the movie's soundtrack is a mixed collaboration of both, which works out well. Bryan Singer did a great job by using the original two movies as source and continued telling the story from a point where it was still relevant. He redid a lot of things that Richard Donner had done in the original movies, and this time he did them right. He removed the ""American Hero"" angle or any patriotic elements that were pretty strong in the earlier films, and he gave the fans a magical Superman and Lois Lane flying sequence as a nod to the original.I suggest you keep an open mind, and watch this movie without the intention of comparing it to the original. The movie has a universal appeal and can be enjoyed just as much by people of all ages.",6,4,gagangb,"Jul 27, 2006",

8,Donner's film is superior but this still hits the spot!,"Bryan Singer moves from his Marvel franchise of the X-Men, to DC Comics very own Man of Steel. The fine work that Singer did with Wolverine and co, is clearly evident in this enjoyable summer blockbusters, although it never quite captures the heart and character shown in particular in X Men 2. Superman Returns still delivers what we'd expect from a Superman movie, and delivers it fully in the 21st century wizardry we all expect. When Superman fly's we believe he's flying.The film no doubt will be consistently compared to the original Superman movie, by Richard Donner, and while Singer has been keen to do his own vision of the man of steel, he has made sure to keep much of what made the original film so successful, in what is a kind of unofficial sequel, or perhaps a follow on. This film takes place sometime after Superman 2, and also quite rightly dismisses the disastrous third and the diabolical fourth. However while Singer has no doubt crafted a top draw summer film, this movie will not have the timeless appeal of Donner's 1978 original. In my mind and many others, the first Superman film is one of the most underrated films of all time. Simply dismissed as a good comic book family film. But Donner's film actually has more character than it's given credit for by some, and also is one of the most witty and funny films ever made. It's a film of comical genius that keeps the audience laughing, and it's and impressive feat for a film that is not actually classified as a comedy. It's just a very funny film with some of the most superbly timed gags in moviedom. Singer captures some moments of comedy, but not to the same degree. However it's an attempt to create a more dark Superman movie, which he does quite well, without ever quite doing what Chris Nolan did for Batman.Now the main comparison point will undoubtedly be Brandon Routh and Christopher Reeve's portrayals as Supes and of course his alter ego Clark Kent. Routh firstly is good. It's a debut that's impressive and he could have easily been out of his depth, or mismanaged as Hayden Christiansen was in Star Wars 2 and 3. Routh though captures both Supes and Kent very well, at times eerily reminiscent of Reeves. There's no doubt that Routh will be a big star now, probably in these kind of movies more than anything else, but while he's good, he is no Chris Reeve. Reeve delivered a fantastic performance that is one of the greatest ever in a ""blockbuster"" film. Sorely under appreciated for what it was, and that was performance of great charm, subtlety and depth, both in his emotive performance but also his physical performance. Reeve is and will probably always be the ultimate Superman, and would be even without his real life courage and heroism. This is in no way a disrespect to Routh, it's simply just how good Reeve was. Ditto to Kate Bosworth who is decent as Lois without ever capturing the verve and vivacity of Margot Kidder. Kevin Spacey was actually a bit of a disappointment in all truth. His Lex Luthor is more threatening than swaggering Gene Hackman (whose association with blithering imbeciles works in detriment to his criminal genius). Spacey has done far more chilling villainy in his career, while his Luthor is a little bit clichéd. Really the majority of the cast do well without capturing the magic that their 1978 counterparts did for Donner, but the exception here is Sam Huntington who creates the ultimate Jimmy yet.Technically the film is great in all respects. It looks great, sounds great and the action is superb. John Ottman edits and scores the film brilliantly, of course taking many of the cues from John Williams classic creation from 1978. The film is perhaps a little long for it's own good but never drags too much and while this won't be wearing out DVD players quite like the Donner film, this will certainly stand up to repeat viewings. It's well worth watching following a thus far disappointing summer of sequels. ****",1,1,supertom-3,"Jul 27, 2006",
5,Superman Returns: But it was a bit of an anti-climax.,"When I first heard of Superman Returns I had mixed feelings of what I would think. On one hand, I love superhero movies, (Not all) but I do love them. Even if there crap, there's something great about them, but this, meh. It was average, for quite a few reasons.The plot was, to sum up in one word, poor. In my opinion, superhero movies should either have a basic storyline (eg. good guy fights bad guy, good guy wins, like Spiderman) or something deep and meaningful and full of metaphors (Such as Sin City) yet still retaining the comic book theme. I don't think this movie had a good plot, having all these really sub-standard side stories. Of course I expected going into the movie that there'd be the whole Lois Lane/Clark Kent sub-story line, but how it was done was pretty boring and frankly, unnecessary. *MAJOR SPOILER* I also found that the realization that Superman and Lois Lane have a son that turns out be some mini superman was laughable, and how it's BEGGING for some made-for-TV series on the many capers of his sons adventures. You know its going to happen, and it makes me shudder every time I think about it, and how it was done so many times before. And also, the boyfriend (Soon to be husband) of Lois Lane seems to be one of the more important figure to help Supermans troubles (Saves Loise lane and son from boat, flies helicopter to Supermans aid, drives Lois and son to Supermans Aid whilst in hospital) and yet his actions are dismissed and ignored, and Lois Lane almost cheats on him with Superman. That's not very moral is it?? *MAJOR SPOILER* Also, what the hell were they thinking putting Superman, (Yes SUPERMAN) into a Coma?? What the hell? He's Superman for Christs sake, yet he needs to be hooked up to a breathing machine?? That certainly wouldn't have happened in any of the other superman movies or comics, and trying to comprehend how someone thought of putting that in the movie is just comical. ""Yes! let's put SuperMan into a coma! Great idea!"" Superman didn't even really help the demise of Lex Luther that much, which prompts the question, ""Who gives a s**t about Superman?"".The acting was excellent in some aspects, not in other aspects. Kevin Spacey was the highlight of the movie I thought, his acting was just a joy to watch. The kid was a bit too ""Hollywood"" for my liking, although you can't really blame the kid, just the dialog. Superman himself wasn't actually too bad an actor, neither was Lois, just nothing special.The special effects were great, visually fantastic, and I do like my special effects in movies. I heard the budget wasn't massive, but I didn't really notice any lack of quality. Top notch, maybe some more action scenes would've been nice.So in a nutshell, I was disappointed, I expected more. It wasn't memorable, but it wasn't awful either. Maybe a new scriptwriter and a few experienced actors would've been nice.",0,0,baz_trinity,"Jul 27, 2006",
10,Superman Returns,"saw ""Superman Returns"" last night in a plush Hollywood movie theater surrounded by devoted Superman fans. That in itself, I must admit, was part of the fun. Brandon Routh is breathtakingly, impossibly beautiful and you can trust that in a Bryan Singer movie stunning looking people will populate the screen. Here, the hero with the sensational eyelashes, works wonders in every single way. There is a hint of Superman as Jesus. Cucifixtion, resurrection, from Father to Son and I bought it wholeheartedly because it deserves to be bought. Kevin Spacey is a fun arch villain. There is nobody as convincingly evil as Kevin Spacey. It was strange, however, to see the lovely Kate Bosworth who played Sandra Dee to Spacey's Bobby Darin in ""Beyond The Sea"" to be so extremely at odds with each other but I bought Luthor and Lane much more than Darin and Dee. Ultimately Superman Returns is a classy, classic rendition of a perennial tale by one of the most successful aesthetes working on film today. Recommend it.",1,0,BrandonJamesRouth,"Jul 27, 2006",
6,"Better than the original movies, but far from Lois&Clark","Well. What can I say about this one? ""Superman Returns"" is a good deal better than the original movies.I feel the director took the old movies and incorporated some of the feel from ""New Adventures of Lois&Clark"". Thankfully Brendan portrayed a much more believable Superman than Christopher Reeves ever did. I breathed out in relief when the bumbling fool Clark Kent never showed up in this movie. Instead we got a somewhat darker, much more smooth and definitely brighter Clark Kent. Kate Bosworth also did a pretty good figure as Lois Lane. Not up to the standards of Terri Hatcher, but far better than Margot Kidder from the old movies. She just stood there like a fool, screaming for help all the time. While Terri actually managed to help herself, and Superman quite a few times. Kate compares much more to Terri, but still falls a bit short.Kevin spacey is pretty good as Lex Luthor. He is a lot better than Gene Hackman who just were Jarjar Binx annoying and stupid. Yes, Kevin comes dangerously close to being better than John Shea in the role as Lex, and would have been, if the script had been up to the standards of the TV-series. But all in all, Kevin did a good job. the only two characters i were disappointed with was Jake Olsen and Perry White. Jake could go, but Perry was so completely insignificant. He was like a blank canvas. There just wasn't anything at all, of the bubbling powerhouse of an editor Perry White is supposed to be. It has to be the lousiest choice of actor in quite a few years.The flying sequences followed tradition, yet were smoother and more stylish. And of cause the special effects were a whole lot better than the old movies, even the TV-series. Sound Track was as always very good. But I got a sneaking suspicion that the composer is the same Lucas used for the Starwars theme. I never noticed that when i saw the old movies. I am not sure whether i like or dislike that they dropped the glow of the Kryptonite, but it may be for the better of the movie. I haven't decided yet. Superman's sickness, helped the credibility of the movie, but should have been taken further. when he finally left the hospital, we should have seen some lingering weakness in him. The boy, were a nice, if hot exactly unexpected twist. But Clark should have told Lois about is double life. Especially now that they have a son. Guess who is going to go completely ballistics when she finds out. Kryptonite got nothing on a furious Lois Lane. Lois's fiancé made me grin a few times, I can't believe they used James Marsden. I just kept waiting for the first beam coming out of his eyes,he he. Well at least I had a few chuckles.All in all this movie is well worth watching, but as revitalizing of an old franchise goes, it doesn't come close to what they did in Batman Begins.

9,A pleasant surprise.,"I remember that I had just settled into my seat when my friend and I agreed not to be too harsh. We had seen a great deal of movies and were, well in my opinion great judges when it comes to such superhero films. I had read few reviews that gave a real boost to this movie at all - there was even a magazine that was so highly against this movie that it kept bragging about the worst qualities Superman owned. In the end I settled that well if it sucked it sucked.I was surprised when it didn't - Bryan Singer (X-MEN 1 & 2) did exactly what I expected him to do. He's always been the sort of type who loves to build everything up, and that's just what he does. He makes a movie that could have had a great deal of simplicity to it - greater and bigger. The thing that impressed me was the humor and the actors. Lex Luthor was perfect - he was a genius who knew how to ruin the world yet he kept a billiard table in a boat. Superman was just plain super - Lois Lane was not bad either, but I feel we'll get more out of her in the next one - if there is one, and I hope it really is.To be entirely honest - we always need a Superman out there.

,Visual treat but narratively challenged,"Seeing a summer blockbuster movie on the big screen is great fun. Seeing it on an IMAX screen with some scenes in 3D is awesome. But that was my experience with ""Superman Returns"". I'm a real fan of superhero films, so I loved ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" and tolerated ""Superman III"" and ""Superman IV"". After an interval of 19 years, it's good to have him back. After all, he is the coolest of the superheroes because he can fly and, post 9/11, we need someone heroic to help us out.This is a somewhat sombre story, set five years after ""Superman II"" as even Lois Lois has decided that the world does not need Superman. When our hero returns, however, he is subject to almost Christ-like images: 'nailed' with kyptonite shards, 'crucified' with arms outstretched, and above all 'dying' only to rise from the dead.Newcomer Brandon Routh is virtually the same age as Christopher Reeve when he first donned the blue cape and the similarities in looks and voice are remarkable. Kate Bosworth is winsome enough as Lois Lane who now has a five year old son. But it's Kevin Spacey as the maniacal Lex Luthor who offers the best performance of the piece.Director Bryan Singer - who gave us the first two ""X-Men"" movies - and scriptwriters Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris have ensured that there are countless visual and verbal allusions to the original ""Superman"" in 1978, but the special effects have come a long way since the start of the franchise. Metropolis looks like an amalgam of 1930s architecture and present-day technology and there are some splendid sets and scenes, including a new version of the shuttle and the creation of a new continent, with a personal favourite being a huge train set.Two things spoil the show. First, as so often with blockbusters, the whole thing is too long (154 minutes). Second, a stronger narrative with more tension is needed to lift this above the pedestrian and make it really fly. But the man of steel is definitely back, the franchise is successfully revived, and I'll be in the stalls next time round too.",1,1,rogerdarlington,"Jul 28, 2006",
4,Nothing New Here,"The early vibes coming out about this film were that it was very good. I was therefore disappointed when I saw the film. Even though it's quite a few years since the last Superman movie, there really didn't seem anything new in the movie.Brandon Routh fills the Superman boots as would be expected. He's equally as wooden as the sadly departed Christopher Reeves when it comes to acting. Bosworth is a bit of an improvement in the playing of Lane though, and the film is at it's best when she's around. Spacey goes through the motions as Luther and the plot is pretty similar to the previous Superman movies.

I wish Lex Luthor would have been more like when Gene Hackman played him. Because now he was ultra bad, and had no humor. When Gene Hackman played him it was great, because Lex Luthor was a genius, but realized sometimes if he had done something really wrong, but then he found a new way to exploit what happened. But now in this movie he was only ultra bad. But Kevin Spacey was great, except for the lack of humor.So I missed the humor.But Superman played by Brandon Routh was great. He is very similar to Christopher Reeves, but also himself. He was true to the films. I hope they never make things like in the serial Smallville and Lois & Clark.

3,"Just another dull, generic, CGI laden Hollywood action film! (I'd rather watch Superman IV: The quest for peace!)","I cannot believe this film currently has an equal 'star' rating to the original superman movie and scores higher than Superman II and III.The original superman films were so full of character, excitement and sass. When watching this film I found it difficult to stay awake. Superman films are always going to be predictable in the sense that Superman will always 'win' against 'evil' and his extreme powers give writers free reign to get him to do anything without raising objections of absurdity from audiences, but this film doe nothing interesting or original, there are no interesting plot twists or story lines. The only story line 'suprise' is that Lois Lane has had a child and she has transformed into a characterless pretty Hollywood face! Kate Bosworth brings nothing interesting to the role of Lois Lane, she's just so wet and dull. Margaret Kidder gave the part of Lois Lane so much more 'balls', the attempt at showing Lois' edginess in this film is portrayed by Kater Bosworth getting a cigarette out of a packet and then deciding against if and slipping it back in the the packet (how edgy! yawn!)It amazes me that Hollywood continue to overuse CGI 3D graphics, if used sparingly and at appropriate times (inconjunction with blue screen, model-work and other tried and tested staples of special effects) it could be great, but in many new action films, including this one, they just swamp films in CGI, but it seem to me that it leaves the film looking unbelievable. The effects and camera angles become too overblown and all subtlety is thrown out of the window. In the final scene of this film, superman soars off into space and around the world looking triumphant (echoing the final scenes of previous all superman films) but it is so CGI enhanced that it looks like a cartoon, even superman himself has been modelled in CGI, and it's looks so obvious, it just doesn't look real, such a weak finale. I know that it must save Hollywood a fortune programming in CGI as opposed to making things by hand but it makes no sense to me that 30years on from the original Superman film the final scene can actually look worse.This film has nothing of any substance to offer, it's not exciting, it's not interesting or funny/quirky. I hoped that the inclusion of Kevin Spacey would give the film weight and although he plays the part well, it doesn't really do anything to lift the film. In fact all the main actors are good and reasonably well cast (with the exception of Bosworth) and act well enough but the film isn't very well written and it just feels like a money making sequel and doesn't have any of the Hollywood magic the original films possessed.Surprisingly disappointing.",1,4,raary,"Jul 28, 2006",

There were a lot of areas where the impressive graphics seemed to be displayed that seemed to last longer than they probably should have. I felt the storyline was also slow and weak in that it tended to follow Superman and his relationship with Lois. I actually felt bored waiting for the next events to happen.

7,... so loved the world he gave his only begotten son ...,"The whole Superman franchise has always fascinated me. I had what one might call an epiphany one day when reading a Superman comic when I was about 8 or 9 years old. It was an especially juicy revelation being coupled as it was with the consumption of the forbidden evil comic book secreted from a distracted cousin. More on that later. That was in the ""Golden Age"" of Superman; when George Reeves was the capped crusader and the heroics where more realistic.Given this long history of exposure, including the last round of movies by the dear departed Christopher Reeve, I had more than a few expectations before seeing this. Actually, the scenario was that there was nothing else on at the local tiny theater I hadn't already seen so this was the night's selection by default of elimination.What we find is the strangely plastic/perfect looking personage of Superman played by an unknown Brandon Routh. His portrayal was no better or no worse that many others who have donned the cape; which, in this particular instance, was an odd color of off-maroon rather than the traditional patriotic RED dictated by the character's long-standing persona of standing for ""... truth, justice, and the American way..."". Come to think of it, the whole costume was a bit surreal compared to tradition. Some things just shouldn't be messed with. Perhaps they feared no mere pretty boy could ever hope to equal the jaw-dropping image of Terry Hatcher wrapped in the red version... we may never know.Other than missing what should have been a slam-dunk for the costume department, they went on to miss taking advantage of one of the most visually stunning things in movies today... namely Kate Bosworth's eyes. Who could not be captivated by them? Still, they all but completely missed playing to that visual delight. Even without that, Ms. Bosworth made a better than average Lois Lane. That was a relief at least.Others in the film were the great Frank Langella as Perry White and Kevin Spacey wasting his considerable talent while doing a better than great rendition of a bad guy. Why do I think he was wasted? Because almost anyone can play bad. Everyone knows what bad is and it's the evil that stars, not the actor. Still, he is almost worth the price of admission just to see his version of it. Parker Posey played his obligatory sex-kitten to a tee. She is equally good in a completely unsympathetic role.The special effects were, well, modern special effects. Nothing surprising but extremely overdone to the point of being ridiculous. The rest, sets, costumes, art direction, cinematography, etc, were all first rate but lost in the details of the overblown effects.What else is there? Well back to my little discovery, circa 1958... it is my assertion - or observation if you will, that the Superman character is the comic representation of Jesus Christ. This movie just underscored that impression even more so with it's heightened use of effects. He is shown as the savior of mankind, all knowing, all seeing, all hearing... swathed in flowing robes, unrealistically good-looking and adored by one and all - except for the emissaries of Satin, of course. His portrayal as a god-like being has never been more pronounced as it is in this film.",5,3,bjones,"Jul 28, 2006",

5,Superman Returns To Hallmark Country,"Super schmaltzy Hallmark/Family Circle overall feeling throughout, with way too many hokey family hug scenes with the blah, blank-eyed, and nearly mute little son thrown in for the ""Awwwwwww"" effect, ruined this mediocre at best movie for me. ""OK, time for another family hug scene!"" Super Ugggg. Also, Superman was so bland and totally lacking in male, no, human, charisma as to not even appear to be the main character in the film. That belonged to Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther, and even he wasn't nearly as good as Gene Hackman was in the other Supe flicks. Even the scenes where The Supe saved something or somebody were flat and lifeless and mostly not exiting. This was really a poor sequel except for the special effects in the kryptonite land mass scenes, and that wasn't enough to save it for me. This movie brand should now be killed off for good as it's getting worse with each sequel. What more can they ruin by making another one? Kate Bosworth was a cutie as Lois Lane but is either a real bad actress or was badly mis-directed as she seemed like she was reading her lines directly off of cue cards, with little shown facial or word emotion along with unrealistically quick responses, kind of like she didn't have to think of her answers and just read them off cue cards.....Oh, right, that's just what she was doing! Really lame and amateurish.Frank Langella, as the Daily Planet Editor, was the bright spot in a small and thankless role, just as he was as the TV CEO in Good Night And Good Luck. He deserves a lot bigger part in films.Lois' new super-caring husband-instead-of-Superman was also in the film way too much. Isn't Superman supposed to be a love story between The Supe and Lois? Why did the filmmakers throw a way-too-concerned-about-precious-Lois-and-kid husband that was way too much in touch with his feminine side, and their dopey kid into the mix? Crummy idea throughout, and it ruined the story as the filmmaker really pushed the family schmaltz angle that was common in 1940's films and is badly outdated now(except for the Disney junk).See Supe 1 and 2 over and over, and forget this crummy flop.

He uses his power's to voyeur people, to listen them without their awareness, to show off. It seems that he lost his special features. These habits could not be suit with Christopher Reeves. The new Superman likes to take pride in himself more than to stop crimes. When he stops the bullets from the machine gun with his chest and with his eye, we understood that his ego went up to the sky. In spite of improvement in techniques, in this series we could not see variety actions in scenes. Actions scenes are not sufficient and most of parts are a little bit boring. I had been checking my watch again and again toward the end and I got sleepy. Lex Luthor were not skillful in this series. He did bad things but with his luck not with his talent. If you did not watch the Superman up to now, please do not get trouble, it is not the end of universe.",0,0,kalay,"Jul 29, 2006",
9,What a surprise.,"To be honest, I was almost determined not to like it. I'd come to regard Reeve as iconic. Replacing him was verging on bad taste. It took a while to warm to Reeve anyway. He was a little on the ""small"" side compared with the comic-book imagery I'd been brought up with. To keep the Action Comics feel would have required a bodybuilder at least the size of Arnold at his most bulked up, and that would be barely making the grade. However, Reeve's presence generally made up for his chest size and he was so charismatic that... he WAS Superman. Add the real life tragedy and the thought of following with a new actor was almost blasphemously daring.This movie had better work or it would fail horribly.From seeing film posters, Routh was frankly too underdeveloped physically, a trend since that TV series with Terri Hatcher opposite the dwarf. I had the distinct impression that the casting brief was to find someone to play Christopher Reeve rather than act the part of Superman.Once past the spine-tingling homage credits, I was sucked in/blown away by an astonishing film. The legacy problem was handled sensitively (dedicated to... ) which was a huge relief. Routh's performance was a revelation. His resemblance to Reeve in certain shots - and in certain mannerisms - was unsettling, yet he managed to capitalise on these assets without overplaying his hand. Overall, I could forgive his ""too slight"" physique for the sake of the acting. I don't think we've seen his last, and even if he's a one trick pony - which I seriously doubt - he's still got a long way to go in this franchise. Yeah, I'd like to see him 50lb heavier, but that's a huge lifestyle (and pharmaceutical) commitment, and maybe not for him.Kevin Spacey stole the show. I always rated Hackman, but thought his Luthor interpretation just a touch too camp; the teeniest touch, not a shaven-headed Kenneth Wiliiams. Spacey was every bit as insane yet managed to be more believably menacing. I'd bung him the statuette for this one, I think.The ladies, in comparison, didn't quite cut it. ""Lois"" felt right - a beautifully played part - but the wrong look. Sorry. Looked very tasty walking out of shot and crawling on her hands and knees though I don't think these were designed to be memorable moments. Likewise ""Kitty"" the obligatory moll. What went wrong here? I suppose ""doesn't work"" for me just means the character isn't appealing. The character was too neutral and uninvolving without the bimbo appeal of a Jessica Rabbit or the verse of a Bonnie Parker. I see the logic in the screenplay, but it still doesn't feel right. She shouldn't present as disposable even if Luthor sees all women that way. It's HIS personal aberration which we don't need to share to appreciate - indeed, our revulsion to Luthor is lessened because of it, and that makes a poor decision in direction.James Marsden - Richard - and Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent. Perfect. Nothing more to say, really, but Richard was successfully appealing and worked on all the right levels. Not too cardboardy (that would have been SO easy) and not too mawkishly handled either. Finely played and well written. Martha was gorgeous. Age aside, the best-looking woman in the film. All the other support characters were well cast and well played. Even the kid (we all want to hate kids in films like this) was attractive, charming and.. just right. Tristan Leabu in 20 yrs time? Could be #1 box office.Downsides. I'll happily suspending disbelief and knowledge of physics for most of this stuff - e.g. there's no leverage consideration when flying and dealing with Large Objects. Superman usually behaves like an object of infinite mass, sometimes with zero inertia and sometimes with infinite inertia depending on the writer's scene requirement.Nevetheless, there are things that irk me. Compared with the weirdness above, this may seem illogical, but I can accept the behaviour of an utterly alien thing/being thrust into our physical continuum, and this is best if there is no great attempt to explain it in other than phenomenological ways - ""Superman came from a HUGE planet so has a denser, impenetrable structure. Our yellow sun gives him super vision, hearing and.. stuff."" Bunkum, but good enough for the job. Far better than the pseudo-science of TNG Star Trek's "" By re-routing the nerdular matrix through the outfeed oscillators I can re-bias the resonant positronic mass to give a precisely 0.326 seconds window to fire a photon torpedo, velocity-matched to the yaw angle pulsator. The transparaluminary widget will activate again if the matter-anti-matter bypass-integrator circuit doesn't burn out."" THAT kind of thing offends me far more than being told that Superman is ""Super' because he's not hampered by a big planet's gravity and a red sun.Where it goes wrong for me is laws of physics changing inexplicably for otherwise familiar situations. I can accept Superman walking into a hail of midi-gun bullets which bounce of him without the impact knocking him backwards even though this is utterly inconceivable in any universe but a magical or SFX one. I can't accept things which aren't ""super"" behaving oddly. Seeing someone carried through the air, sightseeing - and their eyes not streaming and stinging from everything being blasted into them. As anyone who skydives or rides motorcycles will know, she gotta wear shades - or stick a cape over the head. Nowhere in the listed superpowers is ""invisible force field."" Superman descends ex-celestia, upright. His cape hangs DOWN. How? Fishing weights sewn into the hem? Minor niggles, I know, but I'm sure many will understand the logic to my objection.Such aside, I THOROUGHLY enjoyed the film which finished with a ""proper"" ending not leaving us hanging, baffled.I wanted more.Recommended.",0,0,Ivan_Bradley,"Jul 29, 2006",

9,He is Back.,"First of all, I am a die-hard Superman fan, so it kinda feels weird that I did not give it a perfect 10.....to be honest, I shouldn't have given it a 9. This movie was beautifully done and realized by Bryan Singer. I am sure it will make more money than it did to create it. But I felt that there were times that the movie tried too hard to be the Reeve era movies we remembered and loved. I think the director should have made it more fresh, but I love the fact her respected the past material. Brandon Routh was completely flawless as Superman/Clark Kent, constantly fooling us into believing that it was Reeve up on the screen....but that,too, is a set-back. I love Routh's acting, but I would love to see his superman, not him acting out the old. Kevin Spacey OWNS the Lex Luthor character. The right amount of darkness and humor to make Luthor seem more memorable than Hackmans. I think the plot twists thrown in kept the franchise fresh, and allows for something more to be built upon in this story. Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane certainly gives us hope for some interesting stories in the future between her and Superman. I encourage everyone to see the movie about the character that started it ALL!

10,deserves  to  snob,"I can hear the film snobs now - ""just what we need, another bombastic action flick loaded with CGI and cliché in place of a 'SERIOUS' human story."" Yup, it's a bombastic action flick. Yes, it is crammed with special effects. And yes, if you consider simple and largely unexamined human emotions to be cliché, then Superman Returns is loaded with clichés. My advice to the film snobs is - don't review films you are predisposed to dislike. If you do not have a standard from which you are able to measure the worth of a certain genre, then you have no business reviewing in that genre.Let's examine this rationally. The whole point of the character of Superman is to provide a fantastic superhuman persona who is so alien and so vastly superior in terms of physical being, knowledge, and morality, that he becomes a mirror through which we are forced to critically examine our own social, political, emotional, and health problems. What kinds of problems would such a vastly superior being trouble himself with? Well, guess what, he might not have time for the day to day subtleties of social and sexual intrigues and ambiguities, the role of the media in political rhetoric or other ""SERIOUS"" concerns plaguing the modern intellectual elite. Superman is concerned with more fundamental issues such as whether half the world's population is going to live out the day. Yet he still manages to find time to rekindle a dysfunctional relationship with love interest Lois Lane, and to be inspired to prove himself with a flourish of light-speed heroic antics to regain his esteem among a people whose cynicism and self-contempt have apparently gotten the better of them (film snobs all?).Kal-El returns to earth just in time to confront his old arch-nemesis Lex Luther's plot to rebuild a chunk of Krypton off the coast of New Jersey as his own continent. He must also unexpectedly confront his own feelings for the people of earth and, in particular, for Lois Lane, now an unmarried mother with an asthmatic kid and a smoking habit. Lois is also engaged to a good guy, very competently acted by James Marsden, but the paternity of her son is suspect. Considering the fact that this is a ""bombastic action film"" a remarkable amount of time is taken up with developing the relationships between these characters and exploring their effects on one another. And at times, you even get the feeling that at least some of Superman's heroism is inspired by his feelings for Lois.The bigger problem is that Luther has Kryptonite, and plenty of it, and so, Superman is mortally vulnerable and must fight for his own life as well as those of his adoptive species.Ignore the geological inaccuracies (which are plenty), forget about the occasional continuity problems, and let yourself get sucked up into this very fine and well crafted example of the superhero action genre. If you're a hardened film snob, it's worth the effort of wriggling out of your fossilized suit of cynical armor just long enough to see what the value of a film with a positive, simple, message might be.evren buyruk",1,1,petit76,"Jul 30, 2006",

5,Did he return just for this???,"**watch for spoilers**I was disappointed. The story was lame, the dialogs were plain simple, bad acting, like Lois Lane for example (who told her new boyfriend that her son was his knowing he wasn't, very classy) You never connect with her, she expresses no emotions whatsoever. Brandon was OK, but the problem is Reeves was toooo handsome, and had REAL blue eyes, (Brandon's blue contacts were too obvious, they needed better job there) it is not easy to fill in those boots. Kevin Spacey was wasted, he's such a good actor, and there was nothing there for him, you could see he wasn't even trying very hard. too much romance, too long movie, too boring. The movie tasted a little to the old ones, but not as good, they worked great for the 70's but hellooo were are in 2006! we need something fresh, modern and creative. I mean did Superman return just for this? if they were going to do something new, please be a little more imaginative. 70% of the movie was CG or maybe more, that's why the film makers think they don't need a story, nowadays, because they have the visual effects to fill 70 to 80% of the movie. some of the scenes with visual effects were good, tho. And what is this constant comparison of Superman with Jesus???? Even the scene when superman is beaten up by Lex and his guys reminded me of ""the passion of Christ"", that was a little too much violent. Remember this movie is more for kids because with a plot so simple and predictable, it can only be meant for kids.

9,"Welcome back, Supes!","Don't listen to the detractors: Superman Returns is a great film, and arguably Bryan Singer's best since The Usual Suspects. It does to the last son of Krypton what Christopher Nolan did to Batman, only less dark.In order to successfully bring the Man of Steel back to cinemas, Singer chooses to ignore the existence of Superman III and IV (and so does a very satisfied audience), as his movie takes place after the first two S-flicks. And his love for those two movies is evident from the very beginning: after the Warner Bros. and DC Comics logos, we hear a monologue spoken by the late Jor-El (Marlon Brando, digitally resurrected), followed by the opening credits. Yes, it's basically the same credits used in 1978, with a few adjustments. And yes, it's John Williams'unforgotten Superman theme we hear in that sequence. All that can mean only one thing: this will be a memorable return. And indeed it is.The first glimpse of our hero looks like it was made to grab the interest of people who have come to know the character through his most recent TV incarnation, Smallville: Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) lands in the middle of the family farm's corn field after being gone for five years (a similar thing happened in the popular show's Season 4 premiere). We're also offered a beautiful flashback showing how he discovered he could fly (note to Alfred Gough and Miles Millar: the super-speed looks a lot better here than in the TV reboot), before Clark decides to return to Metropolis and try to get his job back. He succeeds, only to learn from old friend Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington, a comic tour de force) that things have changed dramatically in five years: Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who Clark/Superman still loves, has a son, Jason (coincidentally, the boy is five years old...) and is engaged to her boss's (Frank Langella) nephew, Richard White (James Marsden). On top of that, she's about to win the Pulitzer prize for the article ""Why the world doesn't need Superman"". While there isn't much he can do on the sentimental front (Richard is, after all, a nice guy), Supes can still prove the world needs him. And boy, does it need him: evil deeds are in the air, and the recently out-of-jail Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has something to do with it. Once again, he has a plan. Once again, he won't let anyone stop him. And once again, a certain superhero will be in the way...The reason Superman Returns works is Singer has understood the movie can't just rely on visual effects and action scenes. Like in the franchise's first two installments, there has to be something else: a believable, ""human"" protagonist. Superman is unique because he's an outsider, a character who will never fully consider himself one of us (""Even though you've been raised as a human you're not one of them"" he's repeatedly reminded by Jor-El). Nonetheless, he cares for mankind, and fights every day to protect our planet. That's why everybody loves him. That's why, in spite of Lois' article, the world needs him more than any other hero.Of course, the movie would fall apart if the lead actor didn't pull off the job convincingly. Luckily, there's no need to worry: Brandon Routh impresses both as the clumsy, mumbling Clark and the invincible Superman. He can behave like a nerd at the Daily Planet and then prevent an airplane from crashing with the same ease. And, most importantly, he has a touching resemblance to the great Christopher Reeve, to whom the movie is dedicated (it's damn near impossible to read that caption and leave the theater unaffected). Bosworth does a good job too, giving her character, and the movie, the appropriate emotion (she's so good she made me forget she's a bit, eh, too young for the part).As for Spacey, well... He makes Gene Hackman's Luthor look like a nice guy. Working with Singer for the second time (after his Oscar-winning performance in The Usual Suspects), the American Beauty star ditches his predecessor's wig (minus a brief in-joke at the beginning of the film) and funny mannerisms, giving us a portrayal much closer to what younger fans are seeing on Smallville, with just a touch of extra madness (when Lois tells him he'll kill millions of people, he corrects her: ""Billions! Once again the press underestimates me.""). Having not played a villain in some time, Spacey has a terrific time returning to what he does best, and the audience has a great deal of fun watching him.Thanks to its inspired director, smart script and brilliant cast, Superman Returns does exactly the same thing Batman Begins did last summer: it gloriously revives the franchise. A sequel has already been announced, and considering Bryan Singer's X2 was ten times better than the first X-Men film, the next Superman movie will undoubtedly confirm, once again, that not only is he the first superhero, he's also the best.",25,22,MaxBorg89,"Jul 30, 2006",

4,Superman Returns...Now Go Away Again,"After the astonishing X-Men franchise, I had high hopes for this movie. But, Singer managed to only disappoint me. His first mistake was instead of making this movie able to stand on its own, he focused too much on making it an homage to Richard Donner. It felt too much like a rehash of the first movie just with updated special effects. Seriously, go through both scene by scene; so many parallels it's not funny. The problem with this approach gives us a way too powerful Superman and elements that are completely outdated by now, eg a campy Lex Luthor. There was also a bit of miscasting with Bosworth and the main character himself had very little lines throughout the whole movie.The plot was severely lacking. Luthor's scheme made no sense and was just very poorly executed. The ending defied all logic and pre-established canon...especially within the universe Singer was emulating. On top of that, the movie was extremely dull. There were only inconsequential action scenes to show off the new and improved special effects and otherwise no real challenge for Superman.Yes, the first two movies were hardly perfect, but given the time they were made they are quite enjoyable. Supes Returns, however, is not. It's just an empty shell of what could and SHOULD have been in an era where comic movies are dominating. Superman is called an epic character, it's time for them to give him an epic challenge and no more of these stalemate battles with Lex Luthor.",0,1,WOLVERINE25th,"Jul 30, 2006",

Singer is without a doubt one of the most outstanding modern directors to date. The soundtrack is a mixture of original scores from past superman movies, but with a modern age, perfect for the movie.The only big flaw of this film, is Kate Bowthsworth.

4,tragically disappointing,"As a die-hard Superman fan I wanted to love this movie. I grew up with the 50s TV show, saw the wonderful Christopher Reeve and I even watched Lois & Clark back in the 90s-- unfortunately, any of those renditions of the Superman story are better than this movie. There was not a single moment of fun and it completely lacked charm. If you are a Superman fan, do me a favor: go see this film and then immediately rent the 1st and 2nd Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. It will show you just how great the late Mr. Reeves was, and why Brian Singer's vision of this character is the wrong one.Aside from the lack of fun, the story is mediocre. My God, why must they always use the first draft in every bad blockbuster??? I won't rip Brandon Routh--he did OK and had a tough act to follow--but Kevin Spacey is not in the same league as Gene Hackman. And in my opinion, if they used archival footage of Marlon Brando in the film, they certainly could have brought back Hackman--he might have saved the movie. The rest of the characters...well...they just didn't do anything. They slept-walked through the movie.The special effects were decent, especially the flying sequences, but again, go watch what they did in 1980 with Superman II without CGIs. Remember how they destroyed Metropolis? The only reason I gave this a 4 is for Kate Bosworth, who is scorching hot to look at.",0,1,brianhemstreet,"Jul 30, 2006",
1,The Most Boring Movie Ever,"I've always loved superman, wanted to be him, to fly, to have super strength etc,. But for some reason I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this movie, i dunno why, OK maybe it was the previews, they weren't that spectacular to me. But i felt it was my duty to honor the latest installment since I was such a huge fan. To make a long story short Brian Singer has once again reduced super heroes to total wimps. Just plain wimpy. Just like he did to the first 2 Xmen movies, there were all pussies except for magneto. storm was a wimp she barely did anything, rogue, cyclops, the professor, shooot all the Xmen were pathetic when it came to using their powers. X3 may have been terrible but at least my muties were powerful and I have to say Brett has balls . Back to Superman Returns, Really awful move, way to long, I kept looking at my watch. Way too much drama with bits of action in between. there's cool action sequences here and their but it was pretty much boring and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.",2,2,litejay83,"Jul 30, 2006",
3,No more than an average film,"Special effects are nothing special, In fact some are increasable cheesy. Acting is well average at best (I am being kind). Kevin Spacey is the best thing in the movie, he makes an excellent Lex, shame the rest of the cast let him down. True the likeness to Christopher Reeve is there but that is no basis to allow a wooden actor get the job. Should have went straight to DVD. Save your money, eventually it will be on Sky. The film has a highly predictable plot line. At no point is there a surprise or twist you wouldn't have seen. Very Disappointed, if you have seen the trailer you have seen the film. I was hoping I could have said some good things and was looking forward to seeing it however this is not the case.",0,1,Steven-gibson,"Jul 31, 2006",
8,"Wow, I thought I was watching a comic book hero actually come to life","I liked the original Superman films and I thought that no one could replace Christopher Reeves (although to be honest, I didn't think he truly portrayed the Superman of the comic books).And having seen many previous comic book heroes butchered on screen, Daredevil, Catwoman etc, I thought that this film would continue the trend of destroying yet another comic book hero during the transition to film.Well here is a film which captures the dignity which I thought a Superman would have.Brandon Routh is one of the most convincing comic heroes to date and he portrayed Superman as both super and as a man.Kevin spacey was almost convincing as Lex Luthor but I would have liked his character to have been a bit more serious and less comic, but he was sufficiently evil to be an almost worthy adversary for Superman.My only criticism is that the story line was a little underdeveloped and should have contained a lot more action.Whilst the comic book always gave us the idea that Superman and Lois Lane were almost meant to be, I think most of the film (as have it's predecessors) dwells too much on the love interest and not enough on Superman as an action hero.I for one would like to see more of Brandon Routh in action as Superman and I would like to see him battle some truly evil characters in future, because that's what Superman did for most of the comic book stories (he fought baddies).I hope the next Superman film starring Brandon Routh shows us the true Superman because I think Brandon has come the closest to becoming the Superman of the comic books.Definitely worth a watch in my view and I hope it's a promise of better things to come.",3,2,OXO_on_Lsd,"Jul 31, 2006",
1,"An unimaginative , unoriginal, and joyless remake of a superior film","I will keep my review short and simple. Superman Returns is by far the biggest disappointment of the year. After a self imposed five year exile to search for remnants of his home world, Superman returns to Earth only to find out that Lois Lane has moved on with her life. Lex Luther is released from prison and conjures up a scheme to destroy Superman once and for all. Sounds like the premise for a good film right? Wrong!!!!!!! This film plays out like a two and a half hour horrible soap opera. The plot all too often makes no sense. To simply put it, the entire film is nothing but a rehash of the 1978 film but without the charm. Superman arrives on Earth, check. Superman saves Lois Lane from certain doom on an aircraft, check. Lex Luther is the main villain, check. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two leads, Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth. There's enough continuity problems and plot holes to fly a jetliner through them. The special effects are unimpressive, I've seen much better films with smaller budgets that have better effects than this train wreck. Excluding an impressive scene at the beginning of the film, *SPOILER* that has Superman rescuing an airplane as it plunges out of control towards Earth, this film has no action. Bryan Singer, the director of this film has publicly admitted saying that this is his ""first chick flick"". If you are looking for a fun, exciting, and thrilling film, this is definitely not the film you want to watch. Overall, this is a pretentious, dull, boring, unimaginative, unoriginal , and soulless film that should have never been released in the first place. Don't listen to the critics and their biased reviews, take it from me. This film is a massive disappointment, this is why it's struggling to make a profit at the Box Office.",1,4,btresmike,"Jul 31, 2006",

Of course i had my doubts i thought it was just a pretty boy running around in tights but as i saw more of the movie i began to think that Brandon Routh was more than a pretty boy. The graphics in this movie are amazing. Throughout the whole movie i was blown away by the drama, action, graphics and the acting as well.

3,Little MissSuperman,"""Superman Returns"", why? After seeing this I wish he hadn't. And what an overblown lackluster return. I'll bet Marlon Brando is really happy he's dead, 'cuz if he wasn't, this would have probably killed him. If you saw the trailer with the Super Man trying to save the jet airliner in distress, then you've seen the most exciting part. I watched it thinking that after seeing the trailer, this must be packed with really amazing action sequences. As I watched further I surmised that Superman having returned, must still be suffering from jet-lag. The guy acts like a wimp rather than a amped up hero. I longed for the early Flescher cartoons or the 1950's George Reeves TV show and the way he did things there. In this film he acts like he's returned from finishing school, and any emergency is dealt with with just enough energy to get the job done. He's not Superman, he's Just Enough Man. If one expects him to act more powerful than a speeding locomotive, forget it. He's more like Herbie the Volkswagon with sensitivity. And because he's modeled after a comic book (yeah, yeah, I know it's a sequel), many think the relationships and character development must be superficial. But the creators of this limp biscuit should study Spiderman 1 and 2. It had excellent character development amid a lot of heart, yet I still felt like I was watching a comic book! Superman on the other comes up empty. I hope he leaves again, and soon, only to return when he's got the right stuff.",1,1,seer496,"Jul 31, 2006",

8,Super-lative,"Superman is indeed back, and the delight Bryan Singer obviously felt in being responsible for his return is communicated through a film that is as rich and subtle as it is visually exciting. This is action movie-making with both a heart and a brain: plus around $200m to play with.Part of the delight is that Singer deploys his train set in many ways which fans would do themselves, many of whom have nostalgic childhood memories of being taken to Richard Donner's 1978 original version. From the blood-quickening homage to its comet-like opening credits roll, to the posthumous reprisal of Brando as Jor-el it's an affectionate and deferential reworking of Donner's original gilded with spectacular and extend cgi sequences which envision those superhuman qualities in a way wires and blue-screen filming never could.There is some long-delayed directorial truth and justice in this, as Donner was unfairly sacked from the helm of Superman II because the producing Salkinds wished to take the franchise down a 'campier'; route that led to the critical and financial debacle of Superman III and the absolute farce that was Superman IV, which was the artistic equivalent of kryptonite to the franchise in Hollywood.But Warners and Singer combined realise just what a fantastic creative source the Superman myth is, and all that it needs is lots of money and healthy dose of respect, Warners supplied around $200m of the former and Singer does the latter by not attempting to undermine or update the character's core values.Apart from the much discussed religious allegory/symbolism, there are other interesting themes. Singer takes delight in representing applied physics, which is at the heart of how the superhuman fantasy first engages the young: As they become fully aware of their own human limitations of strength, speed and agility, imagining what it would be like to be completely unrestricted by those laws and expanding on that, what that would make them in a society of normal men. The sense of space, time mass, velocity and vibration is conducted brilliantly throughout the film, not just via special effects but also by the imagination of screenplay and cinematography.Brandon Routh matches the youthful Christopher Reeve curl for curl, but it is Kevin Spacey who offers a truly great performance as Lex Luthor. The buffoon crook portrayed by Gene Hackman, entertaining for all that, is replaced by a complex, psychopathic personality, given the space to expand on his own delusional self-vision as a modern day Prometheus 'bringing fire to the people'.Superman and Luthor represent the spectrum of alienation from humanity; one distanced by all aspects of his identity and physiology, the other by his complete absence of empathy. Spacey plays it straight throughout and succeeds in recreating Luthor with a new sense of menace, even as he reprises the same basic plot ideal of the original movie.A huge amount of thought has gone into the art direction and dialogue which are peppered with references to Superman plots and images harking back to the earliest comic book days. The movie is also more beautiful than a superhero action flick desires to be, as beautifully composed as it is dynamically stirring.The overall length, periods of character exposition and old-fashioned feel (Space Shuttles in peril?) may have contributed to Superman Returns under-performing, just a little, its backers expectations. The sequel hangs in the balance by just a few million box office, but it is likely to be green-lighted given Singer's obvious enthusiasm (he promises a sequel as spectacular as Star Trek II was to the original movie) and the fact its mediocre performance was due to unhappy release timing in competition with the Pirates of the Caribbean juggernaut and Pixar's Cars.If that prediction is borne out, good news, as Superman very much deserves to return again.",5,3,gus120970,"Aug 1, 2006",
10,Superman a cross between Appollo and JC,"When I was a teenager I discovered Superman with Christopher Reeve; I found it extremely entertaining and fun but the characters had no psychological depth and that was OK ; Today (no longer a teenager- the mother of 2) I enjoy watching Smallville . Before Superman Returns was released I read nothing on the subject and didn't expect anything , I was just curious and open-minded ; when I first went to see it with my children the theater was to my surprise only half full and at the end I felt just very slightly disappointed - I thought there was a lack of humor and not enough of Clark Kent but I didn't think I'd seen many other films of such visual beauty - so I went once again - and again , and the pleasure grew with each viewing; of course there are some inconsistencies (the effects of the Kriptonite!)and probably some weaknesses in the scenario , but the direction was perfect, Brandon Routh is a wonder both as Superman and as Clark Kent - by the way I found it easier than with C.Reeve to accept that Lois or other people didn't recognize him . The flights are powerful,majestic and yet graceful ; the Christian connotations were OK for me but I understand that some people were annoyed by them. This Superman is incredibly human ;witout being in the least neurotic, he's sensitive, lonely, vulnerable ; this, combined with his (inner and physical) strength and love for humanity makes him a more attractive and likable character than the Superman portrayed by CR. Singer ( maybe he didn't invent this but I don't know the comics - they are not available in France) has not only made him become more human than any Superman before him; he has also made him a god - an improbable cross between Apollo ( the Greek god of beauty and light) and Jesus. I know this movie hasn't (yet) been as successful as expected and I don't understand it; It made me pass through a lot of various emotions and at the end there is peace and joy and enthusiasm !",12,7,amapage,"Aug 1, 2006",
,"Excellent, excellent, excellent","There are going to be people who dislike the approach Singer has taken with this continuation of the Superman story. I for one am certainly not one of them. Skimming over everything, Spacey is excellent as Luthor, combining elements (mainly visual) of Gene Hackman and a touch of Michael Rosenbaums'(Smallville) take on Lex, but also a touch of his own creepy evil streak. Brandon Routh is excellent as Clark/Superman. Very good as both Clark and Superman. And very much like Christopher Reeve's Superman which I think may have been a controversial decision, but it has been pulled off very well. Credit to Routh.Kate Bosworth is good as Lois, but really lacks the true spunky side of Margot Kidder as she never seems to kick up enough of a fuss and comes across as much moany as she is persistent. Some may disagree, but hey this is my comment :D Action scenes are truly top notch and better almost anything else I've seen for sheer impact. My hair was standing on end and my heart racing in a couple of scenes (something that never really happens to me) Music is especially good in places thanks to Ottman's wonderful composition and orchestration of themes while weaving them with new, more introspective material. The story isn't amazing, but the storyTELLING is again awesome. Singer allows the film to lean back when it needs to in a similar way that HULK does, allowing the viewer to immerse in the characters and develop the personal conflicts. There is little in the way of conflict between Superman and Clark.In fact, there is not much Clark Kent time in the film - it's more about Superman, and his struggle to find his place back in a world where so much he held close has changed... for the worse. Singer really shows us his alienation from humans and really makes you root for him on so many levels as he fights and defends people who he is not one of, but so desperately wants to be, mainly driven by his love of Lois. Not having someone you want because you're from a different world is probably something that resonates with a lot of people from different backgrounds and certainly did with me. It's more a love story at heart, but disguises it well until you think back on it and it becomes more apparent.A few nice twists make you think of where the Singer may take this. Of course you'll have to see for yourself :D All in all, the best film I've seen since Batman Begins. Has grown on me a lot.",0,1,Dariunas,"Aug 1, 2006",

6,The Messianic Superman,"On the whole this is a nice film with an outstanding opening credit sequence. I hope that isn't damning it with faint praise. Brandon Routh was extremely good however particularly in the scenes where it was necessary for him to demonstrate his vulnerability. Unfortunately the story is the same old Superman stuff and the characterisation of Lex Luther was paper thin and unconvincing (I think this had something to do with a bad case of miscasting). By far the best Luther around is to be found in the television series ""Smallville"". My main grouse with the movie was the overt references to Superman's similarity to (or perhaps he is supposed to be) Christ. In the floating down to earth section apart from being stretched out on his back in a crucifix configuration he then turned over on to his stomach and began to take on Dali's ""Christ of St John of the Cross"" before, thank heaven, the director must have decided he was over doing the allusions. As to be expected the special effects are excellent and, Kevn Spacey to one side, the acting was convincing throughout.",0,0,janet-55,"Aug 2, 2006",
9,Singer's Action Calling Card,"Superman Returns is Bryan Singer's first truly remarkable action film. This picture is all the more enjoyable if you remember the original Superman with Christopher Reeve. This new, altered version contains many references, story plots, characters and even dialogue as the original - but not in a cheap way for quick effect or easy laughs. Bryan Singer has managed to infuse this film with dignified 'homages' to the original which work superbly.As you would expect, there are a few astounding set, action pieces but the strength of the film definitely lies in Brandon Routh. Any film fan would be a little apprehensive going into this film hoping the unknown and untried lead actor wouldn't embarrass himself a-la Hayden Christensen but this guy really pulls it off! He doesn't play Clark Kent quite as nerdy as Reeve but he equals him as a believable, dignified, worldly savior. He magnificently pulls off that neat trick where you deftly play a subtle vocal change for each character.The only disappointing point would be the film's anti-climax of a conclusion but I suppose Singer was compelled by the studio to quietly sew the seeds for the inevitable sequel.Not as good as the original Spiderman but this gives it a damn good run for it's money!",0,0,Paul_Chung,"Aug 2, 2006",
9,Superman Truly Returns,"I went to see this movie in a digital Dolby theater the day it opened (in Iceland) and the opening credits nearly brought tears to my eyes. When I was a kid I truly believed Superman was invincible, the man of steel. Seeing the opening credits and hearing the opening theme brought back all the fond memories of the man we all know to be super.I loved the movie, plain and simple. Most of my friends didn't have the patience to sit through this seemingly long movie. But me, growing up alongside Superman, thought the movie was too short. The first real action scene is one of the most amazing feats of cinema I've ever witnessed. I was so awestruck at the pure action and CGI that I started to sweat uncontrollably, I got tense, wound my toes and clung on to my seat. The sound, the action, the amazing visuals, the acting and the good old Superman style all generated an awesome movie.Brandon Routh was great at adapting Christopher Reeves' style and the hair made me laugh out loud. The change from Clark Kent to Superman was good and he looked quite like a younger Christopher in a way. Kevin Spacey made an excellent performance as Lex and really seemed like an arrogant powerhungry villain. Those two stood out the most.Even though the movie was a bit on the long side (for most not-brainwashed-superman-fans) it is a great movie none the less. Bryan Singer shows his true talent in taking a comic book and making a great movie.I will truly be looking up into the sky for the next Superman movie.9 / 10",0,0,TraustiB,"Aug 2, 2006",

10,Why the world doesn't need Superman?,"I was waiting for this movie for a long time. The last Superman movie 'The Quest for Peace' had been filmed before I was born. When I first heard that a new movie was being done, I tried to guess how was it going to be. Of course, the villain was going to be Lex Luthor, the girl Lois Lane. But there was one thing that made me think: Was the new movie going to be a sequel of Smallville? I thought it would be wonderful, Tom Welling as a Superman. I learned that it was a free movie, free from Smallville, free from the first four movies. And I wondered about this movie.Many people thought that it will be a full-action-movie. Superman will use his muscles and save the world. We can say as a common viewer that that's true, but on the other hand, if we look beyond the usual movie structure, we can recognize what makes a superhero movie good: the emotions.Love, fear, respect, hope. These feelings look like what every superhero movie has, but they aren't.Lois Lane is still in love with the man you know, her son's father, but she is married with Richard White and although Superman returns, she didn't return to him. Director and one of the writers Bryan Singer didn't let that has a cliché screenplay. Lois didn't return to Superman, Superman didn't turn to life when she kissed him in the hospital, or Lois' cigarette lighter didn't deflate at the end. In addition, I feel the great directing of Bryan Singer at every moment of the movie.He showed us his whole abilities, and made a great flying man's film. There is another thing in the screenplay I like very much. Superman was closer the death than all other superheroes were, although he is the one who is furthest from the death. He threw the earth peace to the space and fell to the ground. He was about to die, thousands of people were in the hospital praying for Superman.Now Superman has a child. It means, in the future there will be more saviors of the world, and maybe a new mixed race. That was a new and mighty move for the Superman mythology. We'll see what will happen.Brandon Routh is a good Superman,and he looks like his predecessor, Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey fits the role of Lex Luthor, but I think there can be better Lois Lane, and that was good to see Marlon Brando again, but the star of this picture is Bryan Singer. I am waiting for a sequel from him, and the others.We have learned Superman's purpose of coming to the earth from Jor-el, but I wish we learn from Lois Lane why the world doesn't need Superman?",1,0,gunes_aydindogan,"Aug 2, 2006",
9,A Welcome Return from the man of steel - we have missed you,"I think there were always going to be reservations about this film. In the wake of the death of the wonderful Christopher Reeve, the thought of there being a superman that wasn't played by him was a little unbearable. My congratulations go to both Bryan Singer and his wonderful cast and crew for making Superman Returns a faithful but modern version of the the man in blue tights. This film is fantastic. The plot, effects, acting, direction. My biggest surprise was reserved for the considerable skills of Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth. Brandon had the bumbling adorable Clarke Kent down to a tee and the strong confident but vulnerable superman was played beautifully by him. Bosworth was even more surprising. I typically underate her as an actress and yet she pulled off Lois Lane brilliantly. She was every bit as annoying, inquisitive, rude, endearing and feisty as the Lois that Margot Kidder played her in the original films. She even went as far as to make the role her own. I wont give one thing away. I made sure I knew nothing about the film before I went and enjoyed it even more as a result of that.

This movie had everything riding against it; telling a story that was fresh and different from all of the others, bringing out aspects of the characters that were new and interesting enough to make the film feel like the actors weren't just ""filling the shoes of their predecessors"" and in that sense it was a huge risk to make this film knowing that the generation that grew up with and ironically buried 'Superman'Christopher Reeves feel a sense of betrayal in accepting a new guy on the big screen. Each of the actors made the characters their own setting it apart from all of the other portrayals of Superman in TV and Movies. The movie never lagged or felt long.

1,"Look, up in the sky: it's a burden, it's a pain, it's Bryan Singer's Superdepression!","This movies has a serious amount of problems and one of it is the script. It's lacks excitement and has many links to Donner's superman II which makes it difficult for the younger audience (who didn't see Donners version) to understand. The plot is terrible lame, director Singer uses the real estate thing Luthor already pulled in Donner's Supes only this time they make it all too serious. Like anyone would be able en would like to live on a dead green rock. I mean common! This idea is also dragged out during the entire movie but never becomes exciting.The beginning and the end of the movie are the worst. The film starts with Superman turning up after 5 years of absence after which he picks up his depressing role as superman which seems to be a burden to him. The ending of the film is SO disappointing I can't even begin to describe it. Yuck! There are some scenes in the film which are pretty good except for the flying which i'll refer to later.Problem 2 is the casting. Routh isn't a bad superman, but he portrays Superman very dull and without any emotion and he fails as Clark Kent. Christopher Reeve had the ability to portray Superman and Clark Kent as two totally different persons which made it believable and he also took the roles not to serious. Routh isn't able to do that by far and lacks charisma. Kate Bosworth is another problem. She looks like a 19 year old teenager and can't carry the role of late in her twenty's Lois Lane with a child. It all just isn't believable. There's is also no chemistry whatsoever between the two actors. Kevin Spacey is the only one who performs good but his character is turned into the totally crap lowlife most sadistic version of Lex Luthor we've ever seen in the Superman Universe.With that said I come to the worst problem of all: the way Singer portrayed the superman universe. He literally ruined it. Het uses so many bad idea's that it's painfully to watch this movie. At some point it made me even sick to the stomach and very uncomfortable. Superman flies in a awful cartoon like way and the CGI looks so fake at some times it's even worse than the blue screen flying in Richard Lesters old versions. Superman takes off vertically in a straight line every time, not like the ballet kind of take off we would expect like in the old superman movies. Also we don't see a transformation from Clark to his alter ego. And what's with the dark atmosphere? Metropolis looks like Gotham city, Superman is portrayed as a weak depressed teenager who doesn't laugh, sores, en doesn't seem to take any pleasure in what he does. Superman also doesn't get many lines in this movie and what he does say makes him seem depressed en burdened. Lois Lane is angry the whole time but doesn't convince a bit while Luthor is to evil and serious but never interesting although at one point in the film it made me want to turn off the movie because of the sarcastic Luthor. Luthor fails to kill off superman in the movie but Singer finishes the job for him introducing Lois Lanes Child, the dark metropolis, a depressed superman with too dark an outfit, a terrible plot, a scene between Supeman en Luthor and his thugs that makes you sick and finally the most disappointing ending of a superman movie i've ever seen. While you are expecting a grand finale you'll be confronted with the biggest anti-climax since Paris Hilton put her own made home video on the internet.There's not one moment in the movie where I felt the magic, awe and sparks I felt with Donner's version. But hey there's hope for all the fans out there! Donners version of Superman II is coming out in November. Now thats the Superman we've all been waiting for for 28 years or so, not this piece of crap Singer delivered us.",4,6,sjeisbroochem,"Aug 3, 2006",
8,Worth the wait,"I'll confess that I was never a really big Superman fan, but since seeing this my 13 year old has suddenly discovered comics, and we've seen Spiderman, the Hulk, Batman (old and new) and the X-Men movies previous to this. None of them caused the same reaction, which should say something about this movie, or perhaps just Superman as a character.Routh looked so much like the late Christopher Reeve that it was poignant; at one point I had to gasp at the likeness. And I liked that they dedicated the movie to Chris and his late wife, Dana. That showed class, something lacking these days in movies. It's how fast and how loud the next movie can be, period.As you can tell, I'm not big on action movies, for the above reason. FX are the main thing (look at all the special features - all they do is tell you how a stunt is set up!), not plot. But comic book movies have more plot than they can do with, usually. I guess that is why I like them. Fans know the story well enough to tell you if you've done it wrong! I'm sorry this did not do as well in the theaters as they wanted. Unfortunately, it is all about money, and now a second movie with these actors is in danger. That's a real shame.I have only one complaint, and it is about the *age* of the actors. I know only 18-35 year olds count these days, but after a lay-over of 5 years, these people look 10 years younger! Umn, that's a problem, if you ask me.Otherwise, if you don't mind your Clark Kents literally right off the farm, the movie was fantastic, and I'd tell everyone to see it, if they haven't already done so! Maybe then we'll get another.",1,0,Simlady,"Aug 3, 2006",
6,Choses to be sentimental instead of entertaining.,"OK Superman is back (and I'm glad he is)! But not with a blast.It's a recent trend in superhero movies to give the story and its character a deeper meaning and more realistic emotions. Most recent example of this is of course ""Batman Begins"" and other examples are ""Spider-Man"" and ""Hulk"". ""Superman Returns"" also tries to put this in the movie. It however does not suit the main character and is not true to the spirit and atmosphere of the other original previous Superman movies. The movie takes itself far too serious with as a result that it isn't always a fun or entertaining one to watch. It tries to be more than just another superhero movie but it never knows to fully convince.The movie in the beginning takes it time to explain the story for the viewers who haven't seen the '78 original and its sequel, on which this movie is a direct sequel again. I can't say that I think this was the right choice. The movie would had been better of if the action, so to speak, started off immediately and didn't wasted any time on re-introducing all of the characters. The movie does however still show lots of respect to the original, mainly with its use of music. The opening credits are done in the exact same style as the original and they also didn't changed a not with its music, which really was the right thing to do. Let's be honest, the opening credits of the original '78 ""Superman"" movie are perhaps the most spectacular and most awesome opening credits of all time, which is mainly thanks to the John Williams music. Director Bryan Singer and John Ottman also seemed to realize and understand this and they use the John Williams at the exact right moments in the movie. John Ottman, on his turn, also composed a wonderful and suiting musical score on his own, complete with a wonderful new Superman theme.The movie feels like two separate stories. One story concentrates on Superman/Clark Kent and the other on his eternal villain Lex Luthor, who is out of prison again, due to the absence of Superman during his court hearing. The movie doesn't feel as a complete whole and it is not until when the two stories mix that the movie starts to take pace and become truly interesting to watch. This however happens too late into the movie to completely save it.The story itself is also very simple, a bit too simple for my taste. It also lacks some of the fundamental things a Superman movie needs. Superman movie needs to be fun, colorful and perhaps even a bit campy. Bryan Singer's Superman world is mostly dark. Also the humor is wrong. The movie does have humor in it but not the right kind. Superman movies needs slapstick, over-the-top sort of humor. The humor and atmosphere in this movie really doesn't suit the Superman character. It makes you wonder; Perhaps isn't the Superman character a bit too old fashioned for the 21th century? The movie concentrates too much on the dramatic and realistic aspects of the movie, such as the whole love triangle and problems between Superman, Lois Lane and her fiancée played by James Marsden, which is far from interesting or compelling.The movie still could had a great one, despite its plot, if it had been a more entertaining one. The movie is lacking in some real good action. Basically the biggest and most spectacular action sequence of the movie is already in the beginning (the plane sequence). After that the movie and its action slows down and the end of the movie could had really used a big and spectacular finale. Instead now the movie doesn't know how and when to end. The ending is overlong, over-dramatic and completely unnecessary. They could had basically summed things up in 5 minutes but the movie chooses an overlong sentimental ending instead.Brandon Routh is perfectly cast as Superman and he also really looks like Christopher Reeve. As expected Kevin Spacey steals the show as Lex Luthor but his presence is perhaps not as spectacular or as memorable as Gene Hackman's. Kate Bosworth is really miscast as Lois Lane. Lois Lane should be a strong, independent woman with lots of life experience. With all respect but Kate Bosworth looks like a fragile teenager.Visually the movie is great and spectacular. All of the special effects are top-class (Oscar nod, no doubt) and they provide the movie with its best moments.I'm glad Superman is back on the silver screen but the the movie itself is nothing too remarkable. In the end it's a pretty forgettable, overlong movie, that is too simple, even while it tries to be so much more than just a superhero movie. I don't mean to sound cruel but you're better of waiting for the DVD. It's not really a movie worth seeing in cinemas.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",41,38,Boba_Fett1138,"Aug 3, 2006",

4,Is Hollywood so desperate?,"I just don't get it.How is it that you go to the cinema to watch an entertaining movie, and the only thing you get for your money is boredom? The main downside of the movie is the length. The genre is action/adventure/fantasy... but in 60% of the time nothing really happens. The action is mediocre, though the visual/audio effect are awesome. Lex Luthor is annoying(they've ruined the character), although Kevin Spacey did his acting superb. It's just like Chronicles of Narnia(which is neither movie for children, nor for grown-ups). You go to see some action, you get instead drama and some flying.Actually if I weren't with company, I would've left the cinema in the first 10 to 15 minutes. I also tried to sleep through it, but the air conditioner was keeping the room too cold. Bottom line: i seriously doubt that any non-die-hard fan would like it.

6,Brandon routh is good pick but..,"i thought that Brandon Routh was a good choice for the role of Superman and can be compared with the late Chris Reeve. But kate Bosworth was not in the same league as other love interests from both film and TV series, so my 12 year old son and i sadly found this hard going as the 154 minutes seemed to go on forever. Kevin Spacey was not a good choice to play Lex Luther and the story line was asking the viewer to stretch reality a bit too far in my view. once again as in many 'super hero' movies the special effects stole the show, with the plane scene proving the highlight of the movie for me.i suspect i will think again about splashing the cash for the next instalment.",0,1,frankgames61,"Aug 3, 2006",
10,Worth it!,"""Superman II"" was the first movie I watched over and over, (the first one was awesome too, but the second was my favorite) so I am very critical of anything Superman. Especially when someone is trying to pick up where Christopher Reeve left off -I consider ""Smallville"" and ""Lois and Clark"" a different take on the story-. I was leery of seeing Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as I love his other work so much I was afraid I'd see that but, boy was I gratefully wrong. I think that both Kevin Spacey and Brandon Routh played their characters perfectly. They ""channeled"" enough of Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeve, respectively, while adding their own characteristics to make them exactly what I think this movie was going for. I enjoyed the other characters as well, though I wish they had gotten a little older Lois. Eva Marie Saint was a charming touch too. The story was great and the continuity from the second movie was pretty close. Hearing John Williams music again made me almost jump up right then and there and cheer. That music makes ""Superman"", ""SUPERMAN""!",13,13,auntloretta,"Aug 3, 2006",
4,singer drops the ball,"This movie made me really mad. The only reason I didn't leave the theater was because it was too hot outside. I also felt that it would somehow redeem itself somewhere along the way. Boo hoo! It didn't! A friend saw it in Imax 3D and said the effects were amazing. I guess its cool to perfect a film element like 3D (3D has almost become a myth!) but that's not enough. Great effects just don't carry a movie for me anymore. It doesn't excuse a lazy script, especially when dealing with an icon. I heard people express concerns about the cast of this movie, but they are all fine - merely wasted by this forgettable story. For a few dollars more than the ticket price, I could have purchased the 2 disc Christopher Reeve Superman movie and there would be no complaints. I give this movie the finger. Bryan Singer fumbled the ball. He took one of America's biggest mythical characters and mailed it in 4th Class. Nobody cheered in the packed audience, no applause. That says something.

9,Great Scott!,"Its difficult for me to say anything at this point really...I'm still trying to collect myself. I normally don't write anything on IMDb, I just read what others write, but I have to say something this time.Superman Returns is what going to the movies is all about..Its why they invented cinemas. Its just that good. You feel its big from the very intro, It has style. I guess I'm saying that the visuals of the film still sticks with me..damn, the colors, the scenes.. the entire movie just looked and felt incredibly cool! ..I feel I gotta say something more.I liked especially the way Singer portrays the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane (and no, Kate Bosworth is not too young to play this role!). The way he longs for her, and even spies on her from the shadows, knowing that he can never really be with her, is perfectly visualized and you really feel sad for the Superdude.Romance and love in a movie like this could easily have gone wrong, but It doesn't. The relationship between the two of them never becomes too tacky, Its just perfectly balanced all the way through.Also the flight scenes in the movie are just incredible..again the visuals are beautifully realized and almost spiritual...wow The comic reliefs are many, but never makes the movie feel too light or lame, and thats because the funny things are once again, perfectly executed and timed. Also, when the action is on I found myself on the edge of my seat with the rest of the audience..the action scenes were literally that exiting and intense, so when the laughs came you felt relieved...a roller-coaster ride, thats what the movie felt like, up and down, up and down....and you wanna go again believe me! I was supposed to stop there, but I just have to mention one of the best scenes of the movie, to me at least..SPOILER AHEAD!...Its when Superman lifts an entire continent (its a small continent, but still)...It's been awhile since I remember being that amazed and gob-smacked in the cinema, but that did it for me...what a scene..how the hell did you visualize such a scene Mr. Singer...my hats of to you sir.

,Lots of good individual moments but it lacks depth and the plot is unconvincing,"It has been five years since Superman disappeared into the skies having returned power to the White House. He left to seek out the remnants of his home planet but he returns to Earth having failed to find anything that survived the planet Krypton. As Clark Kent he returns to his old life and job but finds that Lois has moved on from Superman and Clark and is living with Daily Planet editor Richard White and has had a son. Meanwhile Lex Luther has also moved on, or at least ""out"". Having won his appeal due to a witness no-show, Lex has inherited his way back into power and is concocting his next evil plan.With a massive budget and a massive hype campaign behind it I decided to skip this film for the opening few weekends simply because the opening weekends tend to bring out the talkers and other inconsiderate b*stards in a cinema audience. When I saw it the crowd had only one pair of these so I wasn't too distracted, however I found that the film sadly wasn't actually that good. Scattered liberally across the film are lots of good moments but they are framed by an average film that isn't able to bring them all together. A big failing is the actual story which is a big wodge of nonsense about Luthor getting land – this side doesn't convince and, because it is the backbone to everything else then it causes balance problems across the film. There are good and interesting things in there though. Kent's emotions relating to the loss of Lois are interesting, the action is mainly impressive and individual performances are good. It is a shame that the script lacks the quality to have real depth to support the action and a good story to make it lighter and more enjoyable.I will be honest and say that the character of Superman has never interested me that much (compared to some of the darker and more complex heroes). However I had hoped that Singer would be able to drag out a lot of depth in his character but, aside from quite a few good goes, he doesn't really manage it. It is a shame because Routh is actually pretty good in the lead role. He is good humoured as Kent and also interesting as Superman, however he can only do so much with the material given to him. Bosworth is better though and she works well as Lois. Spacey is a great bit of casting as Luthor but the material prevents him from having as much fun as Hackman once did. He gets close to it but takes himself and the material too seriously. Posey is good support for him but again she loses touch of the fun thanks to the script. Singer makes up for screwing Mardsen in X-Men and gives him a good character here with plenty to do – and he pays him back with a solid turn. Huntington, Langella and a few others turn in solid support turns but nobody draws out any depth or produces a consistent amount of fun. Singer's direction is good though, drawing out his actors as well as he deals with the massive special effects shots – the weaknesses in the film are more to do with the material and not so much him.Overall this is a good film but nothing as special as the hype or budget would suggest. It is better and more interesting than some of the other Superman films but it is not that great. The effects shots look expensive and are quite exciting but the depth of character isn't there and the main plot is rather silly and unconvincing. Good enough for blockbuster audiences and some Superman fans but it should have been so much more.",2,4,bob the moo,"Aug 3, 2006",

Brandon Routh looks like Reeves(may god rest his soul) but Routh also acts like a good superman and a good Clark Kent. As Clark Kent he was clumsy and a push over, so even if people tried to make the connection between Clark and superman, they would get thrown off by his personality. Ms. Bosworth was very intelligent as Lois lane, Kevin Spacey was an insane villain, probably the best villain role in any superhero movie to date(Jack as Joker was on par). The plot in my eyes was quite good, but i didn't like the whole Kryptonite island that much but it was very original, and smart. The flying was mostly computer generated but there were a lot of scenes with Routh on a harness, and i liked the fact that Singer used both. The flying was very realistic and the best in any movie that has attempted to do CG flying, i.e. Matrix trilogy.

The ms is one of the most boring and quiet I ever experience.

This movie is in a class by itself.The realism of the effects was superb. I rarely felt like I was watching an effect at all. The ""hover"" is the coolest technique. Having grown up hearing the roar of Superman's flight in the old b&w TV show, the silent approaches and departures put a smile on my face every time. It was flying redefined.Somehow, they managed to keep the pacing quite constant throughout the movie. I was paying attention to the hospital room scenes just about as much as the near-earth-destruction sequences. There was little of the frenetic rush between things exploding so common to the genre. Of course, having the leading lady being such serious eye-candy may have carried me through some slow parts...Now, if only the critics will take a close enough look to give Spacey another nomination.",4,1,waldenrun,"Aug 5, 2006",
8,"Good, But Only Good","I'll be focusing on the main character himself more than the movie. Superman Returns is, in style, a similar movie to Batman Begins. The story is vastly different, as are the events, characters and drama. But the director's attempt to make the hero more appealing through a realistic emphasis to the movie is the same.In Batman Begins, a big selling point was to make Batman believable. They succeeded better. Superman Returns doesn't fall too far off the mark though. Actually, it succeeded quite perfectly, and that's the problem.Superman is an icon, a perfect being. Handsome, intelligent, wise, with an almost absolute power and incredible perception of all things. And of course, he never lies.Then, he's reduced to the reality drama of modern day TV. Lois has another man, with a kid, and has an angst towards Supes. In ways I cannot tell without spoiling, Superman is forced down to a human level in too many ways. Emotionally, mentally, and physically. That's not what he's about, it never was. Don't get me wrong, the effects are better than anything anyone has ever seen before. You'll believe you saw a real Superman doing all the amazing stuff he does in this film, but unfortunately that's not enough.Whether it's the actor, or the director, or both (and I wager both, more director than actor though), the Supes in this movie fails to live up to what Superman was like when displayed by Christopher Reeve. He no longer commands the incredible aura of supremacy, of the humble but unwavering charisma and absolute power. His powers are that of a Superman, but his physical and psychological demeanor are more akin to a human with a righteous heart, but still just a human. He no longer enjoys the respect and self-esteem he did before. And to me, that's bad. Because Superman was supposed to be Super in that as well, above all else, it was his charisma and personality that made him appealing. *That* was the part that should've been the selling point. *That* was the part that made the first Superman movie as big as it was, namely: Christopher Reeve's portrayal of ""Superman"". It never was about making him human, not this much.The actors all do a decent job, nothing remarkable, but good nevertheless. Routh fits the role quite likely better than anyone else could have, but he's not Reeve. I'm not a major Reeve fan, but to me Routh's Clark and Supes were far too similar. That, too, may be more thanks to the director than the actor. When I first saw Reeve's Superman 1 & 2, I didn't think they were that amazing. It was in retrospect after growing up, that I started to respect the tremendous difference in how he played the two characters. He had the unexplained mystical way of changing his gestures and demeanor in such a dramatic way (most notably, the extreme difference in self-esteem and charisma) that Clark and Superman appeared two entirely different beings. Routh doesn't manage to do this, Supes is too close to Clark, and Clark is too close to Supes. Perhaps that's the modern way, thanks to Smallville and whatnot. But it doesn't work for me.The musical score was good in that it was faithful to the original. It was bad in that much of what was modernized, didn't really work all that well. The score suffered from a similar problem that Terminator 3 did: at times the continuity suffered as a result of poor rhythm and instruments, and at other times there was no music at all when it was clearly needed. Still, it was nowhere near the failure T3's score was. And thanks to the few essential highly emotional scores played in key parts of the movie, I can say the overall soundtrack and its use is well enough above average.As you see by the score, I was satisfied. Perhaps I give this movie extra because it's a Superman flick, but I don't think so. I would say this: My expectations were extremely high, and as such I was disappointed. But only by a little. The movie is solid, and although it's rather long, for anyone with an adult's attention spam it delivers quite well enough. Unlike with Peter Jackson's mammoth films though, here you can rather clearly point out the ~20-30 minutes that could've been cut out to make the movie shorter and more to the point.I definitely hope there will be a sequel. And I fully believe the director and the crew can make that sequel work better than this one. They just happened to have a wrong approach here. Nevertheless, their skill and dedication is obvious. This *IS* a good movie, even if not as godly as I may have expected. A movie focused only on the showoff of incredible effects and no depth of plot or character would have received a 5 from me.

4,Super – Deception !

That's the first problem here: what's exactly is this movie: homage, sequel, remake? You got the same ingredients: music, the classic triangle: Superman/Clark – Lois – Lex Luthor, the airplane crash, the environmental plot...But, as a mature audience now, I wish the concept of Superman would be used with philosophy. Unfortunately, it's only targeted with an US cultural background (as if there was nothing outside the ""small""ville or the ""metropolis""). Well, the director Harold Ramis says it better than me: ""how can Superman spends all his time with Lois while the world is upside-down ?"" The problem with super-heroes today is that they lack super-scripts & the productors don't go for comics writer: for example, when Frank Miller writes about Superman, he is a lackey for the President & fights international wars for him. Paul Dini tells about ""peace on earth"". What a change !Well, I don't call Superman, ""Super – egocentric"" but big powers means big scope.

5,Disappointing,"The contrast between Superman on the big or small screen and Superman in the original comic books has always been too great for my liking. The main series of Superman films from the 1970s and 1980s (well the first two anyway) were good attempts, but still fell short of the comics in many ways. The latest opus in the genre doesn't seem to have learned much from the earlier entries in the catalogue.My main problem with the film is that the characters are flat - there is little attempt to develop any of the main roles beyond cardboard cutouts. I found it impossible to really care what happened to anyone, since they didn't seem to care much themselves.The other problem (as with the 1970s films) is that Luthor is still portrayed much as a villain from the 1960s Batman TV shows. He is supposed to be a cosmic genius, and yet he surrounds himself with henchmen that probably never went to high school. Luthor himself comes across as more of a comedian than an evil super-villain. I kept expecting a fight scene interspersed with frames saying BIFF! POW! ZAPP! As with any Superman film, the plot holes are large and numerous, but we tend to ignore those for the sake of the story. But please, movie people, let's try to put enough intelligence into the dialogue and characterization to give those of us who aren't sated entirely by dazzling special effects something to get our teeth into.",17,15,growe,"Aug 6, 2006",
9,A wonderful tribute to Chris Reeve,"Superman Returns is quite simply a beautiful film. Full of heart, wonder, fun and exhilaration. I guess part of it is due to simple nostalgia, brought on by the familiar title sequence and the fantastic musical themes made immortal by John Williams. But it remains a fact that Bryan Singer has managed to capture everything that made the two first Superman movies so memorable - there are moments of silly comedy, there are elegant romantic sequences and action set-pieces so spectacular, I found myself going 'Woah!' at the screen over and over. And then there's that childish grin that wouldn't leave my face for the entire running time. Seriously, my face was hurting at the end.Upon first view, one might be tempted to hand the film's success firmly in the hands of Kevin Spacey. He simply chews up every single second he's on the screen. Delightfully evil, and with enough intelligence to not make the character one-dimensional. Simply a joy to watch.But - it is Brandon Routh who makes the film shine. He is every bit as charming and believable as Superman/Clark Kent as Christopher Reeve was. His voice, his looks and even the mannerisms are so much like the late great actor, it's uncanny.I see this as the ultimate tribute to my childhood hero. 9/10 - go see it.
